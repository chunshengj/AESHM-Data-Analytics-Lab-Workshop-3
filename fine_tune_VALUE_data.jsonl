The restaurant across the road is really good though and the location in general is good. Walkable and close to public transport. The room was clean enough but felt a bit off, and also lots of things were broken like light switches. Also they took $100 for incidentals at check in which is fine (they also took a resort fee that was never listed anywhere, $50). But a week after check out, the $100 was still being held. So I contacted them and they said it would be returned within 5-6 days max. 3 weeks later and it is still being held. I contacted them again and they have not answered.

I asked the front desk if there was anything we could do to expedite the check-in process--could you flag the reservation? Could I give you my credit card# and email a ohoto of it over the phone and then show it when we arrive? Please, is there anything twe can do now to shave off even 5 minutes it would be helpful? The answer: a resounding \"No\". \"Ma'am, we need to see your credit card and ID\" (understandable) \"And, if there is a line when you arrive, you will wait in that line behind the guests who've arrived before you\". (understandable, but unnecessary to say!) When we did arrive, check-in was pretty fast and not at all warm, but there was thankfully no line. But all that call did was make us more anxious. We didn't feel welcomed and we didn't feel at all like the hotel cared about our business or hospitality. We missed the dinner at our event, so we ordered room service at about 10:30pm. It took 40 minutes (we were told 20 minutes), and then the kale salad we ordered arrived as a regular (very mediocre) caesar salad and the fries that came with the steak were undercooked and cold. the bread was stale and inedible. All for over $100 before fees.The next morning we made a breakfast reservation for 8am. We waited for over 40 minutes (along with at least 10 others) and finally asked if we could take a table we saw sitting empty. We were told the kitchen was backed up, so we ordered quickly, and waited ages for that food to arrive at all, and when it came, again, very sub-par for the setting and the price: cold soggy potatoes, and my sourdough toast was stale supermarket white bread from a bag. The bill for three of us was $125. For a 5 star hotel these rooms are tired. The shower is tiny, the toiletries are plastic wrapped and chintzy looking, and in the bathroom there are plastic wrapped paper coffee cups--not eco friendly, and not 5 star level.

I ended up in what was clearly supposed to be an ADA compliant room - lowered clothes rack, roll-in shower, extra bars around toilet, etc.  BUT they had put a sofa in the entry to the room, and the bed was large, so I question whether it would work for someone in a chair - just someone with mobility issues.  Everything was cut down - no closet, just a rack, a \"desk that was a couple of inches wide, etc.  TV on the wall with a small shelf underneath.  But given what I wanted the room for, it didn't matter.  The bed was comfortable, and it was fine for one night.  There was a bit of noise from the elevated subway line that runs nearby -- but it would make it convenient to public transportation.  The desk was staffed by one person, so service was a bit slow - she seemed to be answering questions on the phone at the same time she was doing everything else.  It was rated three stars, and that seems fair - but I have paid about the same price for a higher quality hotel in other areas of the city.

He then proceeds to immediately cut me off and said that he now remembered me and that he would NEVER say such a thing. I was furious but maintained my professionalism, and this was difficult.  So then he becomes dismissive of my call when I explain that we’re planning a repeat of our last visit and reaching out to him as he had previously instructed.   He then tells me that what I’m stating isn’t possible but to proceed with putting it in writing to him.  I asked about a review with the upper management.  He tell me to include the general manager in the email, and most likely I won’t get to stay there, but ultimately it’ll be up to her — upper management. I’m going to send an email as advised.

You will have to keep the curtains closed as there are workmen literally outside your window ( see photo) The rooms  facing the back of the hotel suffer from noise from the late night bars which line the street. But our real gripe was the state of the room. There were stains on the pillow and bedding and threadbare towels. For the pleasure of sleeping on a stained bed, we paid £350. It was clear that no money has been spent on bedding and furnishings for several years. There are no in room facilities to make a drink and the breakfast was the worst we encountered during our trip.

When that happens, you rely on your hotel to step up.  In our case, the hotel restaurant — Henrietta — was a bit of a disappointment, probably because it competes with fuller establishments nearby.  The dinner menu was very limited and the dining area extremely chilly because the lobby’s outside doors fanned cold air across the first floor (the hallways aren’t heated, either).  The food was very good, just didn’t have many options, which might explain why there rarely was more than a small number of diners in it.  As premium elite members, we had access to the 21st floor club lounge, which was too small to accommodate the larger number of guests for morning breakfasts.  There’s a nice outside terrace connected to the lounge, but the winter keeps guests inside the small lounge. The meals there also did not stand up well to similar amenities we’ve had at other Sheraton properties — powdered eggs, reheated sausage links, wafer thin bacon, etc.  I strongly recommend Tribeca Bagels right next door for great breakfast items.  I was also surprised that the hotel registration desk was unable to break a $20 bill; I went to the small coffee stand in the lobby for change, but the cashier there provided it from his own pocket, not the register.  The bellmen were very polite and helpful.  Our accessible room had several good accessible features, esp the bath, but the king bed swallowed up all living space — anyone in a wheelchair or with a rollator would be unable to get around it or over to the windows.  The hotel does a poor job of handling the parking issue, a major challenge in Tribeca.  Its website only says “self park” for $55 a day, which means parking at the Wooster parking garage across the street and down the block.  I had hoped that Sheraton would’ve cut some kind of discount deal there, but no luck.Our stay was pleasant, but Sheraton needs to invest a bit more in this property’s restaurant and club lounge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

Hotels were very high priced at the start of the 2019 holiday season and we found the Windsor on a booking website (that in itself was an issue since I was booking for 4 people, two adults, two teens. The booking website allowed four of us but the Windsor insisted we had booked a room for three people (I had confirmation for four) many emails between the Windsor and us and between the booking company and us and we were forced to \"upgrade\" for $35 per night to a larger room to accommodate the four of us. I should have cancelled then but rooms were outrageous the week we were planning to be there so I agreed to the the extra $35 a night and hoped for the best.   We were on the top floor (7, aka \"The Penthouse\") which I don't think had been rented in some time. It was FREEZING. The marble floor hurt to walk on but after our 4th day/night of having the heat on became bearable. The elevator opens directly into the room and that was weird and unnerving but ultimately was no big issue. Elevator cards didn't work well and had to be changed out several times. Unfortunately, the elevator also stopped working into our stay so we were forced to climb up and down the 7 stories.   The hotel is just tired and desperately in need of a good cleaning and some newer accoutrements. The 8 or 9 windows in the penthouse had old, dingy, bent and broken white mini binds and they looked horrible and did nothing to keep the light out (and there are a lot of lights on the rooftop terrace that are on all night long). The window on the opposite side of the room had the only curtain in the room and it was filthy and worn, shoved under the in window AC unit. None of the light fixtures had a full compliment of working lightbulbs, the floor lamp didn't work at all. There was a refrigerator and safe in the room (we didn't use the 'fridge so I don't know if it works or not). Wifi works. No coffee maker in room (no cups or plastic drinking glasses either). No coffee in lobby either (thankfully there is a decent store/deli on the corner for coffee and breakfast sandwiches/bagels).   Our room came with a King sized bed (very firm mattress) and a twin (lovely mattress) and we also had a rollaway (also a good mattress). All of the sheets were clean (flat and fitted) and there were extra blankets in a dresser which we needed the first and second nights while the room warmed up. Thankfully NO bedbugs (probably it was too cold for them!). Hot water took about 10 minutes to get to our room, but when it finally arrived it was nice and hot and we got two consecutive hot showers out of it. Towels were clean but old and scratchy. No washcloths or hand towels were provided.   Rooftop terrace (directly accessible from the penthouse and accessible via stairwell for the rest of the building) was the best part of the experience. Views of Lower Manhattan were fantastic, views of midtown were also good.  The Windsor is directly across the street from park and very close to subway. We walked all around the area into Chinatown and Little Italy, to the Brooklyn Bridge and 911 Memorial and the Battery. The Windsor Hotel was a good location for that part of Manhattan (a little trickier but easy to get to for Midtown and Uptown via Subway).  The staff were pleasant, but didn't go out of the way to be friendly or helpfuI. The last night the elevator was broken and since the elevator opens directly into the penthouse, we weren't sure how we'd get in the room. The front desk guy spent 5 mins on the phone with the manager before disappearing down the hallway. A few minutes later he came huffing and puffing down the stairwell as he'd run up to unlock the door from the rooftop terrace into our room. At midnight, after a full day of walking around Manhattan, the last thing we wanted to do was climb 7 stories of stairs, but we had to. We had to carry our luggage down those same stairs the next morning for check out. I doubt we'll stay here again unless management spends some time and money sprucing the place up.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

We had booked a car to pick us up at the hotel to take us to LGA and left our room with plenty of time to check-out.  We went to the elevators we had used for the prior 3 days and one of the two had tape blocking the entrance.  We tried getting the second elevator to come to our floor, but the elevator with the entrance blocked kept coming up to our floor and the second elevator stayed down on the ground floor.  Worrying we were going to miss our ride, we felt we had no option other than to carry our luggage down 16 floors to the reception.  When opening the stairwell door to the lobby, we were met by construction workers.  The space was the same, but the reception desk, sofas, chairs, snack display and anything else that had been there for the prior 3 days, was now gone.  One of the workers told us we couldn’t be there when another interjected and gave us directions through a different door and hallway that opened up to a space we had not seen to this point, where the reception experience had been recreated.  The staff at the desk didn’t acknowledge the change at all and we exited the hotel from a different street than was the only entrance we had used for the 3 prior days.

Gretta their trainee manager is a true lady and would give the impression that she is longer in position then she actually is, as she is so good at her job.

There's basic and there's basic, and this is really basic. An absolutely horrible place to spend the night. Keys don't work well at all. Common spaces are lifeless. There's no buzz or communal feel you normally get with a hostel. Very narrow stairs. Worst, I think, are the staff. The level of antagonism is staggering really. The best you'll get is a stern stare. Never ever expect a smile or plesant word. When you check in (woe betide you if you're 2 minutes early), you're handed a list of instructions and told to pay. No other pleasant communication with staff at any point. Actually it got worse. I saw one staff member try to start a fight with someone staying here.

Unfortunately this was not a pleasant hotel experience. We booked a room for 3. As we arrived, they told us they would upgrade our room to a Junior Suite without charge, so that we get better beds. We appreciated their offer and accepted. The room had no fridge and no mini bar. At the reception we were told that it was hotel policy, but if we wanted, they could get us a fridge, which they normally charge, but they would give us for free. The fridge never came… There was a weird smell in the bathroom and we couldn’t find out where it came from, until we used the shower: there was mold on the inside of the curtain and some unidentified yellow stains! (Really gross) There were only 2 drinking glasses on the table. These glasses were never replaced by clean ones till after the 3rd day when we kindly asked the maid to do so.  There were not enough hand and face towels for all of us. On the 2nd day we asked the maid for some more towels and she immediately gave us some. On the 8th day, we were left with only 3 bath towels and the maid told us that there were no more face or hand towels left. So for the next days we were supposed to dry our hands, face AND body with a bath towel.... The room was supposed to be a Junior Suite, but the furniture looked old and overused, most surfaces were scratched and discolored.  There were no accessible sockets on the bedside so when I moved the bedside table to find one and charge my phone, I discovered a lot of dust and hair which was certainly hiding there for months.  Under the bed couch, were my son was sleeping, we were confronted with the same situation: dirt, dust and hair which were not cleaned for months…. The room was in general not clean. And if you left a used tissue, or an empty chips bag outside the trashcan, you would find it at the same spot when you came back in your “cleaned” room.  At day 3 we had to buy liquid hand soap, cause the little hand soap we were using was never replaced...  For all the above, we paid 520$ per night....…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

Nice enough at check in, told they were going to give us a Empire State building view.  They didn't lie, except for the fact that you had to have your face at the window looking right to see it.   A lot of things plugged in, not looking great.  Bathroom lighting was terrible (yellow, as the wife explained, not good for doing makeup).

Shortly after checking it, I noticed there was (fresh) blood stains (multiple) on my blanket. As seen in the screenshot attached, I called the hotel at least 17 times to address the issue. There phones were not working properly and I was not able to reach anyone. So then I sent two separate emails in which no one responded.  We had back to back reservations for meals, and Broadway shows while in New York so could not wait any longer and continued to try to reach the hotel (and their sister property that has a desk person 24-7) while at dinner over an hour after we found the blood stains. That is unacceptable!   The gentleman who finally entered the phone had no sense of urgency and let us know that the cleaning crew had already headed home for the day (it was about 7:30pm) so he wasn’t sure what would happen and the hotel was full so he just wanted me to be aware. Eventually he did call back and let us know that he would have the room cleaned again with very little apology. At that point I asked him to have the manager call me the next day.   The next day Friday, came and went. No call.  I called again. A woman said the manager is off on the weekend.  So I called Monday. Another woman said the manager was on vacation until Tuesday.  So I called Tuesday.  Not available and no response from the manager.  This went on each day until Thursday the desk person called the manager and the manager said there was nothing he could do since I booked through Hotels.com and all he could offer me was a discounted night in the future. Why in the world would I ever stay in Hotel again where there was blood stains on my blanket!?!  I don’t know what world that Manager is living in, but it is absolutely unacceptable to have blood stains or fluids on the bedding. That is a violation of every sanitation rule the health department. Not to mention the mold growing on the ceiling.   DO NOT STAY HERE! Read all of the reviews below- this is not an isolated incident and the managment is HORRIBLE.

It cost the price of a 5 star hotel, but it fails to deliver. The reception area is a tiny box just off the street, so there's always a crush at the desk, with only two cramped seats for customers available, the lighting throughout is too dark, so that wherever you are you can't actually see properly, including the floor numbers in the lift - everyone was always peering to see where to go. Our room was in an open access hallway with no extra security measures  (worrying) with very dark- bordello lighting so you could not actually see the room keyhole to get the key in. The room was small and again, with poor lighting. It is winter and the only heating was a fan that came out of a ledge that blew hot air into the room - so unless you wanted dry, dehydrating air and a loud helicopter noise in your room, you had to turn it off and freeze at minus-zero temperatures in a room with lots of exposed wooden flooring. The two windows with a block of wall in between let in sufficient light and room service was very poor - EVERY time I called for breakfast, they didn't pick up and I had to go through reception. The club at the top was fine but also very dark mood-lighting throughout the day, and service was off-on  in that most of the staff rush around but are very hard to pin down and the quality of food is negotiable for what it costs.

On our 5 day stay we were convinced otherwise. Having stayed as a loyal Titanium Bonvoy member in other St.Regis Hotels (e.g. Singapore) I had of course some kind of expectation, but this?   Checkin was chaotic and we didn’t receive half the info needed. There was no note or some kind of welcome in the room. After first contact with the butler service they just didn’t pick up the phone and didn’t call back. We tried every day and even after informing front desk no answer. We asked for a water cooker for tee, since there was no tea/coffee service. It was broken. So we had to order hot water for 8$ from the room service which magically worked fine.    Since we used our Bonvoy upgrade option, we got upgraded to a slightly bigger room next to the extremely loud and on weekends busy service elevators which I realized only after 2 sleepless nights. I talked to the reception that I would like to change our  room. The reception staff said that there was nothing available at this point and they would contact us until  14:00.   Guess what… I checked the Bonvoy App and there were 5 different room categories available for our remaining stay… ! So of course nobody contacted us until 15:00 and I again had to explain myself at the front desk.   Heureka, we got downgraded but at least we didn’t have to listen to the service elevator at night any more… amazing what small things can make one happy. Of course the butler service didn’t work on this floor as well.   Breakfast in the restaurant also could not live up to the St.Regis standard, I even had doubt if the salmon was fresh since the plate smelled heavily like fish.

I read the reviews before I left and was a little worried about people's complaints but really, I had nothing to worry about. Check in was seamless, they took my credit card details and held $300 but this was a hold and not a charge. We were informed about the weighted fridge, but told that should we need to chill any items they could bring a small fridge to our room. Obviously we didn't have to carry our own suitcases up, these were brought to us. In addition to the weighted fridge there is also a weighted display on the surface top, this has water, crisps and biscuits on, anything that's removed for longer than 10 seconds will get charged to your room. The room itself was a great size, the bed was spectacular, my partner and I could both starfish and not be touching each other! It has a very comfortable mattress, we slept so well. Being on the 6th floor there was some noise from the street but this is unavoidable, it's New York, famously a very busy and loud city! Unless you're up 15 floors I expect some noise will be heard. The windows did an amazing job at blocking out about 80% but the bull horns on the fire engines/ambulances are LOUD! We didn't eat here because it was a touch pricy and to be frank we didn't come all the way to New York to eat in a hotel. There are 100's of places to eat all within a 10/20 minute walk, my advice would be to go out there and explore. If you come out of the hotel and turn right you will be walking towards times square itself, as well as Broadway. We booked The Lion King at Minskoff Theatre, literally 5 minute walk from the hotel, it was incredible. The shower was a little difficult to work out initially and the pressure is not the best, but it worked and was hot enough! I highly recommend this hotel both for location and for comfort, I would 100% stay here again"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

We chose this hotel due to its great location for the activities we had planned.  We were disappointed in the value of this hotel and I will explain why.  First though, the room was clean, a decent size, and the bed was comfortable.  These are very important things for hotels to get right and the The Muse did this.  However, the most important thing for a hotel is for the guest to get a good night's sleep.    I booked an Executive King room and we were placed in room 1601.  With the sounds of the city below, we did not notice that the room is right next to the elevator motor room until that first night going to bed.  Loud clicks and bangs are heard every time the elevator is in use and given the hotel location next to Times Square and people out and about all night, these noises woke us up throughout the night.  We did not ask to change rooms the next day as the hotel was full and we had already unpacked and its a hassle to move.  I think the staff should be aware of this issue and make sure guests who are light sleepers have the option of a quieter room.  But when I informed the front desk staff about the noisy elevator, they were surprised.  I'm not sure if every floor has an elevator motor room or if we were just lucky to be next to the one on the 16th floor.  BTW, the mini fridge and toilet also make a bit of noise (the toilet must have been leaking as every few minutes it made a whining sound and then refilled.  I only noticed this the last day, so it wasn't a big deal and not reported to hotel staff.  I unplugged the mini fridge to solve that problem).  Additionally, the hotel charges a $40 per day amenity fee.  This was not explained to me at check-in though I was aware of it when I booked the room months before.  It seems the only \"amenity\" was some coffee and apples in the lobby, which we did not partake of.  The bar is closed, permanently it appears, and there is no food available.  On a rainy morning, it would be nice to get a bite of food at the hotel but this is not possible at the Muse.  So, at over $500 per night, without even the option to get a nightcap, this hotel was a poor value.  The room was nice and clean and the bed comfortable, but the other factors significantly took away the enjoyment of this property.   It's a great location so it's a shame the hotel-controlled factors affected our stay.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

Let's start at the beginning: I had to pay my stay in advance (a month and a half before the booking), for that, I needed to exchang emails and call six times until someone answered the call, for finally guarantee it. Then, when I arrived, after 11PM (I had told them in advance), they couldn't find my booking... apparently someone had already checked in, but it wasn't me. They eventually found the booking and gave me the card to access the room. When I arrived, there was a jumper on the bed and the locker was occupied. I went to reception to be allocated another room, and the receptionist said they were overbooked (you should never say that in the presence of customers!!!) and the system was slow. That the system was slow would be acceptable, that they were overbooking and had given the room to someone else by mistake would not. It was after 11PM, I was really tired, I just wanted to go to bed and somehow I was afraid I wouldn't have a place to sleep, even though I had paid for everything a month and a half before. The girl passed the problem on to a colleague at reception, who abruptly gave me another card and gave me the receipt. I told them that I should be compensated for everything that had happened; if it had been the other way round, they would have demanded everything from me. Another girl of the reception said that this was a hostel and that I literally couldn't expect to be looked after like in a hotel, they also told me that I was being rude for demanding something, considering their mistakes and they even laughed in my face of this situation. None of the four people on reception apologised to me for what was happening. I went to my room, everything was fine, I could rest. Or I thought I could rest... On the second night, at 1.30am, the same staff who had been unpleasant to me on my arrival came to the bed I had been allocated with the torch on his mobile phone and said \"I think you might be in the wrong bed\". I woke up startled.  I showed them the receipt, they asked me for taking it with them, I said no, they said they'd take a photo, but I didn't notice they’ve done it. They left the room. However, I couldn't sleep for the rest of the night… it totally freaked me out. The next night (my third night), another girl from reception who I'd never seen before turned up at the same time (1.30am) with the same questions. I thought that, the staff from the nights before, decided to make fun with here and made her going to my room for bullying me. I asked one of the girls in the dormitory, an American, if this was normal in this country? I came from another country and from another culture, these behaviours seemed horrible to me... but that could just be me. She told me that none of this was okay and no, it wasn't normal. On the fourth night, before going up to the room, I went to the reception I asked if I was going to be disturbed again… they said I wouldn’t. On the fifth and sixth night, there were no problems. However, this was probably the worst experience I’ve ever had with staff. Perhaps, like the girl from the reception from the first night said: this is a hostel, you can't expect five-star service! I disagree, people choose hostels, not because they're cheaper, but for the experience itself, which would otherwise be impossible to have in hotels. Good manners and friendliness is something that is transversal to public service in general; if you don't like the job, change. Now, don't you dare bully customers for demanding efficiency and competence!…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

First the back story:  My wife and 9-yr-old son booked this hotel for a Mother-son vacation in New York City.  They booked online--three nights in October 2022.  When they checked-in, they soon started having some concerns about their safety and also the comfort of the room.  First, the room door was already open a crack when they first checked-in.  Second, the faucet in the bathroom was hyper sensitive and it was difficult to get it to set at anything besides straight cold and way-to-hot.  Third, the room was so narrow that in order to get to the other side of the room, they just about had to crawl over the bed.  My wife called me concerned that she and my son did not feel safe, particularly with the room not being secured prior to their arrival.  Of course I worried as well.  I immediately called the front desk and explained that my wife's plans changed and they would need to check out early.  The front desk clerk said she would see if the manager would permit that, she said she would call back.  She did and she reported that they would be able to check out the next morning and receive a refund of the last two nights.  All good so far.  The next morning when they were checking out, my wife asked for a copy of the invoice.  The clerk said one would be emailed to her.  My wife and son checked in to another hotel and enjoyed the rest of their vacation in NY.  Now the frustration.  My wife never received an emailed invoice but when we received our credit-card bill, the full three nights were charged on it.  I immediately reached out to the hotel.  The front desk staff directed me to the manager's email address.  I emailed the manager explaining the whole story.  I did not receive a prompt reply.  When I eventually did receive a reply, it appeared that the manager had not understood what I was asking.  I responded back, reiterating the situation and requesting a refund for the final two nights.  No response.  We decided to contest the charge through the credit card company.  The hotel was very active in responding to American Express.  They finally provided a copy of the invoice stating my wife and son stayed the full three nights.  AMEX affirmed the charges based on the invoiceI ended up calling Choice Hotels (the parent company) to request a refund.  Choice Hotels expressed regret at our experience but noted they could not help us because by this time, more than 90 days had passed and their policies prohibit refunds beyond that time frame.We definitely do not recommend the hotel based on its safety and poor state of maintenance.We definitely do not recommend the hotel based on how the Hotel staff failed to honor their agreement to allow my wife and son to check out early.We are out more than $500 for the two nights my wife and son did not stay and we are not happy :-("}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

The view of Times Square was lovely!  I will add that since this hotel is in Times Square, there's a perpetual faint hum of noise from both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  The hotel does a good job of blocking out most of the noise, but if you require complete silence, be sure to mention it to the front desk when you check in.

We thought the room was a fine size, and loved the hooks to put things on. The staff at the restuarant/bar were incredibly nice (my elderly mother was with me, and they exhibited such kindness towards her - it was amazing). The lounge was comfortable and a great place to hang out. The location was perfect, I've always loved Chelsea - you are near so many great places to eat and it isn't as crazy as Times Square. The few cons were the front-desk staff (not helpful), the elevators (long waits), and it seemed like they were understaffed - the public bathrooms lacked paper towels, etc.  One small thing that would be an easy fix: I would have tiny coffee machines in each room. If your elevators take that long, people need to make coffee/tea in their room. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

I just needed something in upper midtown area for a reasonable price.  I've been to NYC many times, but for some reason just stumbled on this hotel.  Over the years, I've stayed a lot in Times Square area--which I like for the security and \"open all night\" aspects, but hate the traffic.  In recent years, for business reasons, I have trended more towards east mid-town, closer to GCS.  But that area has felt less safe/lively the last couple of years.  Many hotel rooms running $1000+ which is ridiculous.  There is almost nothing they could provide to make that worthwhile.  So I decided to give Carnegie Hotel a try.  It met every expectation. --Small, as expected--but I thought the room was well laid out and it did not feel cramped for me.  (One person, one night trip, not a lot of luggage.) --Good A/C, a must for me--I can't sleep hot --Bigger bathroom than you might have thought.  Very functional. --Water in the fridge--great when I arrived at 11pm, because I was thinking I\"d need to go outside to get it. --Fridge in the room --No coffee maker, but I don't use those anyway --Plug conveniently located ABOVE the nightstand, where you can reach it. --Good lighting, no tricks to finding it --No view--but I didn't plan to stare out the window much.  It where I was (703), it was quiet. --As others have said, breakfast area was small--but I went at 7:30am and found a seat.  Everything was there, coffee, cereal, fruit, pastries, cheese omelets (pre-cooked).  Perfectly fine breakfast--and getting a breakfast at all here is a little unusual, at least where I've been staying. --Extremely reasonable price.  (Of course, taxes etc. add close to 40% of the listed rate--but that's true everywhere.) --Small hotel, but front desk manned at 11pm. --Iron, safe and hair dryer in room --Good wifi --Good, central location (thought that's true of most Manhattan hotels) --The room I was in was exactly as pictured  I have no negative comments.  I will note that they charged $50 at checkin to \"hold\" for incidentials--but I couldn't see anything to buy (no room service or minibar), so assume that's just a cash management tool.

The bath was exceptional with a large walk-in rain forest shower, deep soaking tub, dual basin marble vanity and full compliment of accoutrements befitting a hotel of this caliber. There are 2 venues for eating and drinking: The Drawing Room and Locanda Verde. The former is an exclusive amenity for hotel guests that offering a quiet atmosphere to drink and dine from the Locanda Menu. The Locanda is a bustling tavern-styled facility serving Italian food-fare. The menu is seasonal but you are bound to find star items like My Grandmother's Ravioli and Sheep's Milk Ricotta. I went with my old stand by: Lamb Chops, but I did muster up some Liver Mousse. An exemplary amenity is the Shibui Spa: a luxurious facility that  has it all.......from beautiful lounges to unique treatments for all kinds of revitalizations and opens up to an incredible pool with access to a top-notch gym center.So if you like luxe to the max, embedded with an old world aesthetic and a sanctuary ambiance..........then try the.........Greenwich Hotel..........an exquisitely designed property."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

I stayed hundreds of times in the Accor hotels all over the world for more than 30 years, with good satisfaction most of the time. But this time, I must admit that this hotel not only do not deserve the Sofitel brand, but has a shi**y service which I could not think was possible at this price level ! First, when you enter you get in a desert corridor, nice and warm, but with nobody to welcome you and tell you that the reception is hidden in the back. You feel very welcome ! I was checked in by a very nice and polite senior guy. And that's it. The room is old but very comfortable. I arrived at 10pm after a long flight and needed to drink a good beer and get a light room service dinner. Not only you have NO MINIBAR (check the room prices !!!) but the room service stopped at 10:15pm (the restaurant at 9:30 pm !). I could not believe it. I had to walk outside to have dinner. In the morning, late wake-up : no coffe machine in the room. Since I never have breakfast and just an expresso coffee, I checked the room service and finally got a 28 USD proposal for 1 coffee and 1 croissant. Which is just totally crazy. And with an expexted time of delivery of.... 30 to 45mn !!! LOL x10 I decided to go downstairs to have an expresso at the bar, but after the breakfast closed at 10am, the bar is not available either !!!! I had to go outside again just for a cup of coffee at a regular price, not a 20 USD small cup of coffee. In the evening, I had a very good dinner at the Gaby restaurant, with nice service, I can sincerely admit it. The service, in general, was ok, but really not what you can expect from the Sofitel brand (neither the room quality, decor and amenities), especially at that level of price. The staff seemed bored and not really guest oriented (with exception of course). This was my worst experience with an Accor hotel in more than 30 years, and it made me really think about changing my default travel hotel chain, because if they can accept this kind of unacceptable level of service under their name, this must mean that they have a SERIOUS problem. Will NEVER come back again. An ex-Accor enthusiast guest who will reconsider his future choices for his numerous future travels. VERY UNHAPPY.  …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

This hotel is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in whilst on vacation. It is certainly the best hotel my partner and I have stayed in NYC and between us we have visited the city 6 times from Scotland.   We arrived in NYC on the 26th December for 10 days to get married all the way from Scotland.   When we checked into the hotel and mentioned this to the staff we were given a complimentary room upgrade with a spectacular view of the Empire State Building on the 17th floor. The staff at reception were lovely and made us feel extremely valued, their customer service was exceptional.   The hotel facilities were very modern, classy and made you feel very relaxed. The lobby bar was excellent as were the staff and the food. The rooftop bar was incredible. The view of the Empire State Building from inside and outside on the terrace was amazing. Again, the staff were also lovely and very welcoming and would always find you a seat during busy times. They really looked after their hotel guests.   The housekeeping service we received in our room was excellent and the little chocolates left by staff each time our room was serviced was a lovely touch.   The location of the hotel is great and is within a short walking distance to most of the main attractions and tourist spots including a 5 minute walk to the main hustle of Times Square.   The management staff in particular, Scott and Evan, could not have been more personal and welcoming and couldn’t have done anymore for you. From checking in all the way to checking out, we were made to feel extremely valued by all the staff at the hotel which added to our overall visit to NYC for such a special occasion. The staff at reception also took the time to ask about our wedding day and asked to see photos we had taken, great from the staff taking a genuine interest in their guests.   This hotel will be our first choice hotel for all our future visits to the city, in my opinion you will struggle to find better. Thank you to the staff at the hotel for making my partner and I feel so welcome and we are delighted we carefully researched hotels prior to booking because The Archer truly was the best.    Will definitely be recommending the hotel and will be back again in the near future!!…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

First of all, when I woke up at 6:30am because of the noise (rooms are not isolated as there is no ceiling in the cabins and are located in a corridor of 50 cabin rooms), I found 5 bed bugs on my pillow. I directly complained to the reception and, although they changed my room (they did not seem surprised though), they did not disinfect this room and gave it to another client the same day. Deliberately attributing someone a room infested by bed bugs when you are aware of it, is just unacceptable.In addition to bed bugs, rooms are cabin rooms and are much smaller than shown on the pictures, with no window except for very few rooms. All cabin rooms are located in a big room and are separated from each other by a fine wall and they have no ceiling. Anyone making noise can be heard in all other cabin rooms. Also, if someone turns on the light during the night, you will see the light in your room. All this makes it hardly possible to sleep after 6/7am in the morning even if you are a heavy sleeper.Finally, the hotel is extremely cold and they only give you a very thin blanket. I was freezing the first night, and had an interrupted sleep because of the cold (in addition to the noise and the light) so I slept with my coat, my scarf and two jumpers the night after.In conclusion, I can understand the history of this hotel (staff of The Bowery House has preserved and restored every detail of the remarkable 1940’s cabin craftsmanship and in turn provide unique, authentic and historic accommodations) but not at this price (~100USD per night) and not at the cost of the essentials of hygiene (bed bugs). Their motivation is definitively more cost saving than preserving the history of the hotel"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Otherwise everything’s was close by and metro it’s also just in the front.

The rooms are small but nicely designed and utilize space well. A single traveler or an urban couple used to tight quarters can make it work. The hotel bills itself a five star property, which it is most definitely not. Having stayed in many NYC hotels over the years, this is a nice, but unremarkable spot in the mold of many other boutique properties that have come and gone over a three to five year cycle, that will work for the right guest but actually could be great if only the management and staff wanted it to be. Service is unenthusiastic and without the five star polish you’d want for premium pricing. Dining is serviceable but not great, though the library workspace is a nice setup for travelers, especially since it will be hard to work from your room with such tight quarters. The hotel does not have a gym onsite which is a huge, and curious miss for a Marriott managed property of this size and profile. Overall I would give four stars, except for the lack of a gym, which knocks it down to three, and is such a foolish miss making it hard to envision personally booking there again until that changes.

We did notice a few inconsistencies when reading these reviews that concerned us, so we made sure to mention the reported  noise levels ask for a room much higher up (ahead of our stay) and we were immediately accommodated.  Now on to the good part: Super easy to find, fabulous location, staff super friendly and helpful! Tea and coffee in the lobby area until about 9:55 am each morning --  how nice! Keep in mind, this is a FOUR star hotel, and I'm rating it as Excellent \"as such.\" It is a wonderful and affordable option for those of us who do not require luxury, but functionality and cleanliness.   Upon checking in (fast and easy) we went up to our room on the 20th floor at the end of the hall and found the room ready and very clean. A card was on the desk for us from Mgt wishing us a great time in the city and for us to have a comfortable and enjoyable visit.  The bathroom was NOT old, nor was it moldy. The room, while snug, was not restrictive. The safe in the closet was in what we considered the right spot and there was a foldable luggage rack in there to put your luggage on when unloading or storing, which we used. Our room had a King-sized bed with a sofa-type seat at the foot and across from it was the desk, chair, and the wall-mounted flat screen TV (which we did not use, as we didn't come to NYC to watch TV or hang out in our room.) The room itself \"faced\" other buildings and not the front street, but it's all good -- when in a city, EXPECT a city view, okay? The sirens were not NEARLY as bad as someone else said in a review, but yes, you'll hear them, though not intrusively.  The water pressure in our room was excellent and the water got HOT fast -- we loved it. The bed was comfortable and the mini-appliances, which are arranged on a wooden shelf unit, were very helpful to us. There is a Whole Foods Market about five minutes walking distance (on Madison Ave) and we bought fresh fruit and other snacks to keep in our room in between eating out, and for our breakfast (we didn't eat the breakfast in the restaurant due to our dietary restrictions). Our friends, whom we met for the long weekend, were on floor 16 and loved their room, telling us it was clean and QUIET.  Other than the \"Sorry for our construction\" state of affairs on the main level (and isn't that actually a good thing, to see renovations in progress?) I can think of NOTHING that went wrong and no question that wasn't answered by the staff correctly. (Special shout-out to Richard and Gil)  Upon checking out, we were able to store our carry-on bags with the front desk (they have a room for this purpose and one can also leave them there if arrival time doesn't match the check-in time) and it rained one evening while we were in town and got a loaner umbrella as well!   We needed a way back to LGA to catch our flight home on Monday and the man at the front desk told us that while they can't call a taxi cab for us, they have an arrangement with a private company. He showed us a rate of $63 for the trip from the hotel to LGA, which was within mere dollars (two-fifty more than our trip from LGA using a city yellow cab) so we went with that and were able to schedule it for exactly when we needed it. The ride ended up being $73 and not $63, but both of us believe that it's because the vehicle that arrived to pick us up was a huge GMC Yukon -- smooth, safe ride and our driver was a really good fellow, too! So, it was well worth the unexpected $10 extra for a ride where we weren't stressing over a rental car, navigating unfamiliar streets, and trying to merge into the airport, etc etc.  Our time with HGI Midtown was really smooth, easy, and enjoyable. I hope your stay will be, as well!  …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

The location is great, next to the Subway, lots of fast food stores, so after a long day walking, you can grab some and take back to the room, Dallas BBQ restaurant which is close by, was enjoyed by everyone.The staff we spoke to were mostly very nice, some, just OK (bit annoying when your are still having to tip them!)We arrived at the hotel at 3pm, we had booked 2 rooms and neither ready, that is fine we were 1 hour early for checkin. Reception said it could be an hour. At 5pm we went back to the hotel to checkin. One room was ready and couldn't give me a time on the second, went back each hour to check and eventually got into the room at 8pm!, my 2 children and I had been up since 4:30am UK time, so it was 1am for our body clocks, we got an apology, but no offer  of room credits like others have mentioned, I would have thought a 4 hour delay, for a room that has been booked since March 2023 would deserve some form of compensation, question's for management, how do you determine who you give room credits to? why is this offer not for every customer you have inconvenienced, how do you choose who gets it??? The hotel knew in advance how many guests were staying on the 1st of Jan, so maybe should have factored that into the house keeping rota's - greed perhaps? The room itself was good, nice beds and shower and plenty of room. The views were also great and the WiFi was excellent.We did breakfast once and only once, it was pretty poor for the amount they charge, think Travel Lodge in the UK, budget hotel basic breakfast and way better than we got. The kids were happy their teeth were still in tact after trying to eat the bacon. And all of the kids said \"we don't want to eat there again\"The bar was OK, we used our room credit for cocktails one night.Checkout was quick and the door men were very friendly, always a hello when you got back to the hotel.All in all if you ignore the ridiculous amount of time they take to get your room ready, the hotel was nice. I suppose I should read more into reviews before I book, as there were a few recent reviews for this hotel that were quite poor, lesson learnt!, would I book this hotel again - no, I think having to wait 4 hours for a room that you have paid for with no reimbursement is shocking, If I had stayed beyond check out time by 4 hours, I am sure I would have been made to pay a late check out fee -  manager, would this be correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

Does not introduce himself. Seems like an employee, and just walks out of our room. Confused, my partner and I look at each other wondering, who is this??! We call the front desk to tell the situation- they look at the log and first say it was the “bellman”- then change it to “houseman”. The manager, (she said her name was Gwendyllon no name tag) calls back and says it was the “houseman”, we get skeptical of this back and forth change of titles, and they quickly offer us another room.  We agree for the new room, but we really wanted to know- what was the so-called “houseman” doing in our room, and does not introduce himself nor does he have any housekeeping items on him. We decide to look at the other room which was a total downgrade from the previous corner room that the nice lady at the lobby gave us. Since we did not get the answers we were looking for and did NOT want to settle for a downgrade of a room we go downstairs to talk to the lobby staff/manager. Instead of explaining the situation and giving me answers on who the stranger was and what he was doing in the room, she keeps pointing out that we offered you another room. When asked about the “bellman/houseman”, her answers are defensive saying it is how it is. She says it was “Mike the houseman” who does routine checks of the rooms before guests come in. The manager does not seem to understand on how to communicate nor was making us feel at ease of this situation! I don’t know what to trust!

Although the hotel is new and very clean, I did not like the way the rooms were arranged. The room is basically split down the middle, with a bedroom at one end, and closets, sink, separate shower, toilet, and a small makeup table on the other. There is a sliding door that can be left open or closed. The room lacked additional seating areas. You either sat on the bed or a small stool near the makeup table. The room is separated so that one person can get up and get dressed without disturbing the other person sleeping. But once you went into the other area, there was no place to sit and have coffee or just hang out. I felt this design made the room feel smaller. The other issue I had with the hotel is a missong wallet and lack of concern from the hotel staff. The night before  we were checking out, I realized my wallet was missing. It had all of my credit cards and drivers license in it. I had left it on the bed that morning while in a rush, but when we came back to the room, the bed had new sheets and the wallet was gone. I suspected it was rolled up in the sheets and tossed in the laundry area. I immediately called the front desk to explain the situation. I was told that someone would get right back with me. Several hours went by and 2 more calls to the front desk, but I never was able to speak with house keeping or security. The next morning I called the front desk 2 more times, until finally security came to our room at 11 am, after I complained that we had to leave for the airport at 12 and I did not have an ID to board the plane. Security was no help at all. He wrote down a few notes and said he was going to make some calls and get back with us ASAP. By 12 we went down to the lobby to get a car for the airport. The security guard was chatting with other guests and basically just hanging out in the lobby. We made eye contact and I was walking over to ask him about the status of my wallet, when he hurried away and went into a room for employees only. I did not expect the hotel to find my wallet, but I did expect them to at least try and locate it, or communicate with us better. There are many hotels in New York, and I just feel the Virgin is lacking in customer service, which is why we will choose a different one next time we visit the city. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

It's within walking distance of Chinatown, The Brooklyn Bridge and South Ferry. Though if you're after evening nightlife and restaurants, you will have to walk at least a few blocks as most of the places in the immediate vicinity are closed after normal working hours. The hotel itself is decent enough, it's got all the amenities needed and has very spacious rooms for the area. It is let down however by its general state of repair and a feeling of lack of care. The whole place feels very dated and rough around the edges, you've got scratched and scuffed walls and paint, broken picture frames, furniture full of marks and scratches. It just feels like it needs a complete refurb and it was maybe nice like 10-15 years ago. In terms of cleaning. The room seemed clean enough when we arrived, though the pillows sticking out of the cases did have some stains. But the standard of housekeeping throughout our stay was very basic. They just came in and made the bed, emptied the bin, folded the towels and replenished the toilet paper. It didn't even seem like they had swept the floor, they didn't replace the glasses in the bathroom. The worst though was that on two occasions our room was left open and unlocked by the housekeeping staff. It seemed that the door should slam shut and lock when closed but it just stayed ajar if not pulled closed. We mentioned this to the receptionist who sent someone to \"fix\" it, but it happened again!

I verified this with a measuring tape.  200 square feet is not a rounding error, it is fraud!  The total area includes shower, toilet, bed, etc., by the way, not space to move around.  Walking space, including in the bathroom, is about 60-65 square feet.2 – When I called the hotel (there are no live people; the hotel provides “touchless” service) to point out the discrepancy between actual and stated size, I asked if I could move to a room that was closer to the advertised 200 square feet.  The employee agreed to move me the next day.  So, I packed up the next morning and left my things to be transferred to a new room – which turned out to be exactly same size! 3 – The first room got too hot (77 degrees); however, the new room was hotter.  I woke up sweating at 2:30 am to blasting hot air and a temperature of 86 degrees and rising!  Only by running an air conditioning unit 24 hours a day was I able to get the room down to the lower 70’s – while the temperature ranged from 42 to 55 degrees outside.  If the room overheats that badly in the fall, what would it be like in the summer?  4 – The bed was so hard, I had to put an inflatable pillow under my hip bone to sleep on my side.  I could go on about lower-priority complaints, like the tedious online check-in process, lack of table and chair (though “all rooms have them”, I was told on the phone), harsh lighting, lack of decaf coffee, inconvenient outlets, and cheap construction, but none of these were deal-breakers like the four issues described above.When in NYC, find yourself an ethically run hotel that covers all the basics and delivers on its promises – not The Ridge!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

We travel there at least twice a year. This particular vacation was fraught with disasterous airline/FAA controllers issues. We were trapped in NYC for an extra week because of the enormous amounts of cancelled flights. We booked the Belleclaire for our forced extended stay due to our familiarity with the hotel (we have stayed there before).  Let me first tell you that we have always enjoyed our stay at this hotel. But, it was quite conforting to know that even though we were stuck in NYC for an extra week, we would be well taken care of by the hotel and staff. The staff, all of them, from management to the regular employees are wonderful. They are responsive to requests, they help you with transportation and things to do and see. We also couldnt ask for a cleaner hotel. They really take pride in their appearance and it shows. I mean, come on, this is NYC, the land of tourism! You would think that with that much foot trafffic coming and going, the place would be kind of run down, worn out. I assure you that it is not. An additionak benefit is the most lovely french cafe in the lobby, yes it does get quite busy, but people like good things so the crowds can grow for the cafe alait and pastries. The location of the hotel on the upper west side is perfect. When in NYC you tend to walk a lot! This hotel is centrally situated and is walkable to most spots you would want to visit. The subway system is still decent in NYC and this hotel is close to the subway lines. The added benefit for us, is the location to Columbus Ave, Broadway and Amsterdam Ave. Theses streets on the UWS contain so many restaurants and bodegas that you will be able to eat, whatever tye of food you want, whenever you want. So a quick recap. This is our favorite hotel in NYC! I reccomend staying here any time you travel to th 'Big Apple'. Kudos to the Belleclaire for this gem of a place.

I checked out within 30 minutes of arriving.  The primary issue was the ill fitted single glazed window which allowed a very strong draught to blow constantly into the room.  The draught was so severe it was like being outside, I am certain I would have got pneumonia or worse had i stayed a night.  The bed was right next to the window and could not be moved due to the size of the room.  There was a little heater below the window which made an unbearable noise but gave out virtually no heat and certainly not enough to compensate for the draught.  Other more minor matters was that the room was presumably last decorated in the 1970's with furnitureto match.  The bed springs were completely gone and the bedding was  green color with evident stains from use over a many number of years.  The bathroom was dirty, full of grime and mold, I am glad I did not need to bathe there.  I asked initially to change the room and was told they were all the same, so i checked out.  The only positive I can say about this hotel is the location, but for not much extra there are far nicer hotels close by.I asked for a refund and the manager replied not even apologising and stating they \"do not issue refunds for the room being a little cold\"; they completely ignored everything I had written.  They obviously had no interest except keeping my money.  I have therefore raised a section 75 claim on.my credit card for a refund, as the roon was not only not as advertised but was a health hazard.Honestly do not stay at this hotel.

If something failed, he said let's try something else. Then after that didn't work after awhile, he said hold on we'll figure this out.

Such a strange night.    Just the facts, no opinions here:  - Asked for medium rare salmon, got well done, no pink; asked for medium lamb, got rare, fully red. That's $95 right there, done wrong. Salmon wasn't hot when served.  - When we were sat, 30 min before anyone came to take a drink order, even though there were 7 of them walking around this small dining room in their suits, with only about 7 tables to serve. While we saw with nothing but menus, one of the men chatted that entire time with a tall blonde who was eating alone. During the whole night, no-one ever even said they'll be our waiter: the person who did wait on us said \"I'm *above* the waiters, I'm the *captain*\".  - Ordered flat bottled water, they poured sparkling.  - Waiter saw my emptied plate and said \"I see you enjoyed the salmon!\", so I had to tell him about the problems, he immediately went to the manager, she came over. I described the problems with the entrees and no-one coming to our table, showed a photo of my salmon that I took before finishing it, showed her an untouched cut of the lamb.   - She apologised, took both our entrees off our bill. - At the end of the night, we were told our entire bill was on the house. We had the salmon, lamb, bottled water, and 3 drinks from the bar (cocktails are $28 and up), that would be at least $175, though I never saw the bill.  - I said to the waiter, \"That's very gracious of you, thank you, I was a waiter for many years and I never saw that done for anyone\". He replied \"Yes, well, the woman seated behind me is the general manager for the *hotel*, and she saw the whole thing\". I'm assuming \"the whole thing\" refers to me trying in vain to waive down a waiter to place an order, returning the sparkling for the flat, describing the problems to the manager, etc. She saw the entire team fail at every turn, from the smallest things to the largest, front of house to back of house.   So I was feeling like they had really addressed the issues, but that's when things got REALLY weird. The waiter, who was white (the entire staff was white), then randomly told us a very long weird story that inexplicably was about three unrelated people of color, two of those anecdotes being related to their sexuality. The monologue began with \"I'm not a racist\" -- it was inexplicable why he included that. \"I had a roommate in college, she was a -- this is a weird word -- a *mulatto*, it means half black half white, she used to walk into the common area *topless* to get coffee in the morning... We never *asked* her to do that, she just did it... I used to have a coworker who was black -- *African American* -- I once said to her, we need to hire more black people, she laughed and said 'I *am* black' -- I'd forgotten she was black, ha ha ha... One of the lifeguards in college, I thought he was black, he had brown skin and the kinky hair, turned out he was Spanish, he was really buff, several girls would come talk to him at the same time while he was on duty\". My gf and I aren't black and no-one ever mentioned anything about black people, so his long monologue about three people of color was mystifyingly out of the blue.   The website for the Carlyle says this: \"Unparalleled among Upper East Side restaurants, The Carlyle's New York fine dining establishments set the bar for culinary artistry and flawless service.\" Tonight they were unparalleled only in that no other restaurant I've been to in my 23 years of living in Manhattan managed to fail in so many areas.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

First red flag when I arrived: no smoke detector in the room. I immediately alerted the staff to this alarming lack of fire safety - and it took 3 days and several follow-ups for a properly functioning smoke detector to be installed. At one point, a staff member put an old one on the ceiling that only had 2 out of 3 batteries in it - and of course wasn't working properly, contrary to his assurance that it was working \"totally fine\". It felt like I was being treated as dumb. On top of this, my request for a discount for the last night of my stay due to this substandard service was flat-out refused - the employee said that \"we never give any discounts, even when there are complaints\". I would have left early and switched accomodations if it hadn't been for a busy schedule and the fact that the conference I was attending was in walking distance.Other things weren't great either: no fan or window in the bathroom, constant noise of running water from somewhere inside the walls in the bathroom, cigarette burns in the duvet cover, a window that could not be opened properly (it was a guillotine window where the panel did not click into place when pushed up), and payment is cash only (very inconvenient). At US$150 (incl tax) a night for a room with a queen bed, St Mark's is relatively affordable for Manhattan. However, I have stayed at much cheaper hostels with dormitories in the past that were in better condition and had better service than this place. Next time I want a private room in Manhattan I'd rather pay a bit more. St. Mark's Hotel gets one point for location (very central near Astor Place metro, NYU campus, Washington Square Park) and one point for the room+bathroom being clean."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

After our plane was delayed for 4 hours from Dublin we arrived at Tempo NY Hilton Times Square at 11pm on 23rd Dec shattered, stressed, tired and disappointed we missed out  on the daytime sight seeing because we should have arrived in the afternoon. The hotel lobby has a beautiful entrance which gave us a big lift from our damped  spirits.  I enquired at the check in desk about the pending charge on my card - Tempo NY Hilton Times were holding £528.74  since 21st Dec which had limited my spending power I was told it will be refunded back to my account once  we checked out.  So I Paid the room in full however I kept asking what were the charges the staff would not say and tried to take payment from my card which would not go through my bank blocked Tempo!!! After confirming authorised with my bank  payment went through smoothly.  Next morning found I was charge almost double for the room.  So I still have  a pending charge holding my £528.74  plus I was charged a room with 2 queen beds  for £451.92 (tax, service already included and already paid in full )  and a security deposit was taken for £161.89 which is still at pending stage all of this for 1 NiGHT stay!!!!!!!!!  We are still in New York and my trip  ruined with this continuous enquiry, emails etc a  week has passed, the pending charge for £528.74 is still ongoing inclining the security deposit I was told should be refunded 2-3 days after check out.  I complained to booking.com where I made the booking they raised it with Tempo NY who declined my complaint.  Furious I contacted Hilton Reservations and Customer Care Team.  Theyvacted swiftly, apologised profoundly about the confusion, frustrations etc and stated my booking was cancelled !!!! Hence I was charged late payment!!!  Strangely my booking invoice confirmed no cancellation.  Tempo took out another reservation and charged me again.  Also they states my 17 year old son made the booking in his name and  2 rooms were booked and late payment were charged to him ??!!!!!! I’ve never heard anything so ridiculous in my life. I thought 17 year stays free hence 2 queen beds were book for 1 room. So the theft Tempo NY Hilton still holding  my £528.74  and trying to bush everything under with this so called cancellation, son booking, making a long list of excuses with their ‘investigation’ , stay AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL they employed  dishonest devious staff who would do anything to mislead  and manipulate your booking and bill charge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Yes the street is noisy but so are the other surrounding 10 streets and 3 avenues, a price you pay when you are close to Times Square, especially during Christmas. Yes you can hear traffic from your room (we were floor 18), however we also visited The Edge and could hear traffic when we were 100 floors up, you can't visit a central city location and have an issue with traffic noise.The staff were lovely, we had no issues with the food at breakfast (normally the New York bagel) always served warm and fresh.  The lifts worked with no issues. Rooms were clean, beds made fresh every day, towels replaced every 2 days.All in all a good, clean comfortable hotel with friendly staff in a central location."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

As we stayed 6 nights we had a maid service after 3 nights. From a decor and furniture perspective the hotel and suite itself were all of a high standard. We made use of the coffee/pastries/croissants available on the roof terrace each morning. I arranged transfers via the hotel all of which went smoothly and check in/out were all quick and efficient. Suite was available a couple of hours early for us on the day we arrived. A suggestion for the hotel is to provide some coat hooks in the rooms.The area around the hotel is excellent with downtown tourist attractions all walkable and the nearest subway less than  5 mins walk away"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

This hotel ticked all these boxes with ease.The tempur-pedic beds (we booked another stay within the same week upon check-out after our first stay) in both our rooms were some of best ones we've ever experienced, it was a joy to take a hot shower (and bath) during the cold November days and the staff were always friendly, knowledgeable and greeted you with a smile every time you passed through the lobby/reception area. And as many reviewers before us, a special shout out needs to go to Seki and Gina - you won't find better people in any hotel anywhere.The continental breakfast (served between 07:00-10:00 AM) also outdid our expectations. As we've travelled a lot in Europe, a continental breakfast usually means a few slices of white toast, jam/jelly/marmelade and maybe a cup of watered down coffee.To find both delicious bagels with several choices of cream cheese, yoghurts, fruit and pastries with your coffee/tea - together with the beautiful skyline views over the city (breakfast is served on the 20th floor) - wasn't the worst way to start off your day, on the contrary.And as others have mentioned, in the afternoons, before heading out to dinner, they offered wine hour everyday (free of charge) between 5:00-6:00 PM, on the same floor, this time accompanied by nighttime views of the same skyline.Yes, the hotel in general - and the rooms - have some wear and tear to it/them which we're certain will be rectified once their renovations are completed.We would like to point out, that the staff was more than welcoming to receive, and took notes, on any feedback you would give them during your stay in regards to the hotel and its facilities in order to take the necessary action either immediately or to be added to their \"renovations list\" for the future. Always with a smile and thank you.Overall we felt that, all of the main features were in order, so we didn't care if the elevator upholstery is dated - it took us up and down all the floors safely, and fast, we might add.Could the breakfast and wine hour area (on the 20th floor) use a minor 'makeover' with dimmed lighting, a few more plants, candles on the tables, some Ibiza chill tunes (playing during wine hour) and a generally cozier atmosphere? Definitely.But we enjoyed our fresh breakfast every morning while watching the sunrise and in the evenings we enjoyed small talking for an hour and a few glasses of rosé wine on the house - so what's not to like - if you've seen the prices for a glass of wine in any NYC restaurant.We have stayed at several different hotels and locations throughout the years in NYC when visiting, but this is the first time we honestly can say that we know that we will come back the next time we're in town - it was simply the perfect fit for us and our budget.Well done Hotel on Rivington!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

It brought me to tears because I was there for yet another funeral. She quickly said “I’ll take great care of you, I want this to be the best experience for you”. She gave me a beautiful view, offered water….. she offered me a robe and slippers. I know that I don’t have that type of “STATUS”, but she went above and beyond like the superstar she is!

We got two rooms on the 4th floor. If you book a room with one bed, it will face the street and be noisy, noise insulation is non-existent so you will hear all the garbage trucks at 3 am and everything else. If you book a room with two beds, it will face the back and have no view, but be quieter.  The best thing about this hotel is room size. By New York standards, the rooms are huge and even by normal standards, they are largeish for a three-star hotel. The hotel has gone through a complete makeover when they changed owners a few years ago, and the rooms are in good condition, albeit rather ascetic. The beds are comfortable and there are plenty of sockets by the bed. All sockets are of the US type, so bring an adapter if needed. There is a large desk (with more sockets), a luggage rack, a fridge, and in the rooms with one bed, there is an armchair as well, but no coffee table even if there would be room for one. Amenities include a safe, a bathrobe and slippers, but no bottled water. The AC is efficient but a bit noisy. Wifi was free, fast and unlimited, although it required a few log-ins every day.  The bathroom isn't large, but okay. It comes with your typical American shallow bathtub which is not really suitable for taking a bath. There is a handheld shower with only adequate but not great  water pressure. Soap, shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and body lotion come in tamper-proof wall-mounted containers and are C. O. Bigelow branded, which is well-suited for NYC.  There is no breakfast offered at the hotel. There are several breakfast options nearby, some more crowded than others and all insanely expensive.  While the receptionists and maids were friendly, the security guard was way out of line, having guests run up and down for restroom keys that weren't really needed and making up his own rules about which of the two staircases should be used. Perhaps he would be better off working somewhere other than a hotel.  The hotel enjoys a great location on 35th Street, half a block from the E train that takes you to JFK and close to several subways, shopping and eating options etc.  We paid $365 a night, including all taxes and \"resort fees\". I would gladly give the hotel four green dots if the price were a hundred dollars less per night, but at these price levels, even with the large rooms, it doesn't deserve more than three dots. It is, after all, a very average three-star hotel with few services.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

That first night, when turning in, it was discovered that the bath water ran BROWN!  After letting it run in hopes it would clear, they called the front desk to ask for help. The engineer said he could do nothing about it, and other rooms also had this problem.  My room was okay, and my other son’s room was okay, but when I asked to move my son, his wife, and 2 kids to another room, they were told that wasn’t possible.

The décor and mood are soothing and details are attended to as expected in a hotel of this caliber.After two stays I have a few notes that would make the guest experience even more superb.We booked our stays using Amex Platinum (Fine Hotels + Resorts) which guarantees a 4pm late checkout amongst other perks.These were not reviewed nor discussed with us at our first stay. We were surprised by a phone call at noon on checkout day asking if we needed assistance with our luggage.  The Amex perks had not been applied.To Aman’s credit, during our second stay, they reviewed these perks specifically and adhered to them.We experienced the omakase at Nama which was fabulous.  We wished there was a sake pairing, but none is offered.The iPad in the room doesn’t display the menus at Nama or Arva nor does it allow for reservations to be made from the device.  This would be useful.The brunch/lunch menu at Arva was hit or miss and the menu had strong breakfast or dinner-ish options but skips over good lunch options (wraps, salads, sandwiches)I had a fabulous spa treatment. However, once changing into a robe and leaving the ladies’ locker room, usually there is a relaxation area to wait for your therapist to take you to the treatment room.  There is not a dedicated area for this, I could either wait in the sauna/steam room, in nice seating outside the locker room in the hallway, or inside the pool area.  Then my therapist had to walk us downstairs to the treatment rooms. I’d much prefer to go to a pre-treatment area near the treatment rooms to relax with some hot tea.For some reason we had issues during both stays getting items delivered to the room.During our first stay, we were met in our room by our butler, who asked how we take our coffee in the morning (there is a Nespresso in the room and sugar).  I said milk, which wasn’t brought.  We went out for the evening and forgot.  I called again in the morning for milk, and after about 30 minutes I just had black coffee.  The milk was never delivered.During our first and second stay, I called for a bucket of ice since we’d brought our own bottle of scotch.  The first stay I had to call twice.  On the first night of our second stay I had to call 3 times over an hour and a half before the ice was delivered.  On the second night, I called and asked for ice again, but after 45 minutes it hadn’t arrived.  My husband got frustrated and went looking for an ice machine (about 11pm).  He saw a staff member and explained the problem, the staff member was very concerned and we had a bucket of ice delivered in about 5 minutes.  Of note, upon our arrival the second stay I asked the butler for milk and it was delivered very promptly.  The takeaway here is there is there seems to be a defect in the communication/execution process for these small but meaningful requests.When we checked in for stay 2 we noticed the room was cold and used the IPad to adjust it to 70 degrees.  After dinner we came back and it was still cold, however we went to bed.  In the morning we addressed the concern with maintenance who promptly troubleshooted the issue.  The temperature control was locked to 60 degrees due to a prior guest's request.We received the wrong room on our second stay.  We booked the 56th street Premier Suite for the floor to ceiling windows and different layout, however after our stay we realized our room was a Sanctuary Suite facing 57th, which was smaller and lacked the floor plan we were expecting.None of these should deter any sane person from staying at Aman,  these observations are constructive feedback to an otherwise outstanding property.Update 8/24 we received our folio after 5 days (!) and we were charged for an open bottle of whiskey, which was open when we arrived. We brought to the attention of both the staff who came to restock the minibar and the front desk during our stay.  This is annoying.  The service is broadly good but details are lost."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

It was a rainy day and the hotel was easy to find. It is located at a corner. You go up a short flight of stairs and reach the small lobby. Front desk ladies are very professional and pleasant . Lobby was bare bones with a small seating area and a stand with some NYC brochures. The room was pretty basic. Doors had a good lock. Our Full Bed was clean , pillows were nice, plump enough and fresh and the white bed sheets were fresh and nicely starched. Air conditioner was newer and worked very well and the bathroom was also very clean. It was a relief to come to a nice cool room with a clean bed after a long day of walking around. However it isn’t a luxury hotel. The paint job on the walls is fresh but is poorly done and one of the black out curtains had one hook missing so the edge was dangling. The closet had an ironing board but no iron . The coffee table had one mug and a couple of packet of instant coffee and cream but no coffee maker. Turns out you have to walk to the front desk and ask for the iron and coffeemaker if you needed one. There was a small lcd TV which was working. There were two clean white bath towels in the bathroom but no hand towels . At least the towels were clean and fresh. The floor , shower curtain and the  tub was also newly scrubbed and very clean.  Toiletries were sparse . One single bottle of shampoo. They were out of soap bars. I had to go to the front desk and ask for more towels and another bottle of shampoo which they apologized for but gladly provided.  So, would I go back again in the future? Yes. For one night it is more than what I need.  It is a clean basic bed and shower place to crash into after a long day of walking. If I had to stay more than a night I would bring my own soap and coffee maker next time. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

The Elevators were out but as others have mentioned , they are doing their best with allowing guests to use the service elevator .  We never had to wait more than 5-7 mins and this really didn’t impact our trip. We enjoyed the fresh cool breeze with the window open each night and it really wasn’t loud at all. I find the New York City noise really relaxing . If I had to say anything negative and only very minor things that I’d like to see in a nice hotel like this is maybe a coffee machine and the fridge in our room was just a fridge randomly placed on the floor and not built into the tv stand like most hotels . But as I said , this really wasn’t an issue and I’m just trying my best to think of one negative thing.  As it was Christmas , we paid quite a bit for our room but was still worth it . I checked prices out for out of season dates and they are well below what the hotel is worth per night .  Thanks to all the staff for making our stay so great.

In addition to spacious rooms (we opted for the 1-bed terrace suites), which we very well maintained & appointed, it was their service & hospitality that made our stays memorable. A special thanks to Petr, Gul, and their team for assisting us all through and ensuring our stay was nothing short of perfect.The property is located in the vicinity of Murray Hill and right on Lexington Avenue - it's a mere 5-minute walk from Grand Central - which is pretty much the main station to go around anywhere in the city. Within a radius of 10 minutes walking distance, you'll find multiple restaurants, bars & stores - most Indian restaurants in Lex are a few blocks away :)The hotel building is a heritage property albeit is very well maintained. The terraces extend a grand elevation to this stately structure. Inside they have a spacious lobby with a sizeable sitting area. They have a self-service laundromat, which is a brilliant utility to have onsite, and being so central one doesn't really miss a convenience store or a dining outlet.Our rooms (1-bed suite with a terrace) were unlike any other we've stayed-in at NY, meaning they were spacious and very much so. The hall had a working, dining, and sitting area with access to the terrace (more on the last part later), while the bedroom had a large king-sized bed and a sitting area. The rooms also had a kitchenette and enclosed storage areas. The rooms were clean and immaculately maintained, well-lit, and very well-appointed (with large LED televisions and plug points & USBs aplenty). The bathrooms are again spacious, though those with a bathtub can be a little difficult to access. The kitchenette is complete with a sink, refrigerator, coffee maker, and microwave - so very useful if you want to heat a snack or host someone. All things considered, the highlight of our rooms were the terraces (with one of them being exceptionally large) - they were resplendent with stunning views of the Manhattan skyline dotted with the Empire State Building, the One Vanderbilt, the Metlife facing us. One can spend countless mornings and evenings just watching them from here...While they currently don't have a functional restaurant but have one coming up in early-24 and maybe a rooftop bar - would love to try them when next staying hereThe service across the board was top-notch, and getting assistance from Gul & Petr while booking was priceless. The front desk was very accommodating to our request for early check-ins, they helped us with collecting our multiple Amazon parcels and consistently helped us in navigating our way across the city. That apart, their cloakroom staff, their doormen, and their housekeeping were always helpful, pleasant, and a pleasure to deal with. This culture & attitude is something that will make any hotelier proud of their set-up.All-in-all, our experience with the Shelburne Sonesta was nothing short was splendid. They went out of their way to make our stays memorable & comfortable. While at times, one can consider the hotel to be a tad expensive, it's definitely worth it for the sheer comfort, quality of service, locational convenience, and overall experience. We could not recommend this place more to stay-at when in NYC. Thanks team Shelburne."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

I enjoyed it very much. I ended up booking myself into this place because of the crazy prices of hotels in NY. And what a pleasant surprise! Of course, you have to be ready for a different experience. It is NOT a regular hotel. It suitable only for people travelling alone and you have to be happy with the basic minimum. No luxury at all. But you get a clean \"pod\" with everything you need for a good night sleep. Despite the pod being individual, soundwise you are not completely isolated from the other pods and so you are able to listen to anything is said in the other pods including.....snoring!:-) But nothing that a set of earplugs (provided by the management) cannot solve. And people are very respectful and keep quiet. The shared restrooms and showers are perfectly functional and clean. The 24/7 breakfast is simple but sufficient (plenty of fruit, cereals, juice, milk, yogurt). No coffee! Only tea and hot chocolate. And the spiritual touch invites you to meditate about what is important in life (books provided in your pod) and how many things we have are simply not necessary. If you are ready for something different and like travelling of the beaten tracks and do not need luxury....this could be your place! Plus...location is amazingly convenient.

My wife and I decided to book this hotel for the weekend due to its great location (it really is situated perfectly). On arrival, we were very happy to be able to store our bags at the front desk prior to check-in, as we arrived in the city far before the check-in time.  After check-in, we were happy to have a nice room with a good view. However, our first night at this hotel was honestly so bizarre and odd, and our subsequent encounters with hospital staff were so poor and gaslighting, that I cannot help but write a review about this experience in hopes that any future traveler won’t walk away from this hotel with such a ridiculous story.   My wife and I went to bed around 10pm on our first night. At roughly 1:15am, I awoke to the last ring of the hotel room phone, and before I could reach it, I heard my cell phone vibrating as well. When I checked my cell phone, I had three missed calls from Joseph, the front desk staff member, with three separate voicemail messages. My initial thought was something horrible must have happened, as that seemed to be the only rational reason to place so many calls so late at night.   I promptly called Joseph back, at which point I thought I must have still been sleeping when I heard his reason for the call. He told me that the woman who stayed in our room the previous night was in the hotel lobby stating that she had left a valuable item in the room’s safe and was needing to retrieve it (the safe must not have been checked and reset between guests).   Joseph had called the room phone, and my cell phone FOUR total times at 1am to…….wait for it….. inform me that a complete stranger (importantly, not management, but the woman herself) would need to enter our room where my wife was still sleeping at the time, to retrieve this mysterious valuable item at ONE-THIRTY IN THE MORNING.   After I made sure I wasn’t still dreaming after hearing that request, being a reasonable person, I stated that I understood the situation and would was happy to allow this previous guest to retrieve her item the following day, even first thing in the morning. However, being that I was paying in total over $300 a night to have a safe and private room, and being that my wife was still sleeping and that we had an early morning to prepare for, I was not comfortable allowing a complete stranger to enter our room in the middle of the night.  It was clear from Joseph’s response that this was not going to be an appropriate resolution to the problem, as he stated again that she needed to enter the room at that time (I found out the following day that the New York City Police were involved at this point). Ultimately, in an attempt to preserve our façade of privacy, I located the safe and saw that it was not secured to any solid structure in the room, and told Joseph that I would take the safe to them.   So, still not sure if I was dreaming about carrying out a jewelry heist, or simply following the remarkably persistent and untimely requests of the hotel front desk, there I was at 1:30am, carrying a hotel safe across my chest with a mysterious valuable object inside, through the hallway and down the elevator into the lobby. I went back to Booking.com and looked at the terms and conditions of our stay, and for some reason, I just could not find any place where it mentioned either allowing random strangers into our room in the middle of the night, or carrying safes into the lobby.   The next morning, after very little sleep after the safe-heist,  I approached the front desk to debrief on the evening’s events. I told the nice woman behind the counter that I was hoping to speak with Joseph in hopes of determining an appropriate compensatory discount to our stay for the significant disruption. She said that unfortunately Joseph was not working currently, but she told me not to worry, though, as they had already granted $20 off the previous night, and $50 off the following night for the inconvenience.  Considering the absurdity of the event and resulting lack of sleep, I told her that $70, which equates to 11% off our 2-night stay, simply did not seem sufficient. She told me again that Joseph was not working but that I could stop by that evening and speak to him, which I agreed to.   Surprisingly, though, 30 minutes later my wife and I came down from the room and there was Joseph, working behind the counter! Apart from an apology, we were told that there was absolutely no further compensation that would be provided in light of our disruption. In fact, he seemed profoundly surprised that I was not happy with the original compensatory discount. It honestly made me reconsider the absurdity of the event (I reconsidered it and decided that yes, it was still absurd).   I told him that his unwillingness to make the situation right was surprising, as it was clear that they valued the prior customer’s experience so much that he was willing to compromise our personal peace and privacy in the middle of the night to allow her to retrieve her item! He didn’t seem to appreciate the irony like I did.   Ultimately, no further compensation was provided, and while we had no further issues the following night, we left the Leon Hotel with nothing more than this bizarre story and a desire to never receive 4 calls from the Leon Hotel front desk in middle of the night ever again.   While the hotel itself is nice and the location is great, I am sure you can find a place to stay that will accommodate you as well as the Leon hotel accommodated the guest from the night prior to ours, and not how they accommodated us.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The building itself is very secure and located right across from a police station. The accommodations, while basic, were clean and tidy, and the communal bathroom and shower appear to be cleaned twice a day. The staff I interacted with were friendly and more than happy to offer help. Not a lot of noise can be heard from the street, at least not from where I was staying. The communal kitchen, dining room, and courtyard were nice, and I enjoyed chatting with other students and travelers over breakfast.Cons: The hostel is definitely showing its age. There are no elevators and the staircases are pretty cramped (especially with luggage), so keep accessibility in mind when booking. There was no AC unit in my room, so I needed to sleep with a window open most nights. The communal shower took quite a bit to heat up, and some of my friends had problems with having to wait until housekeeping was done cleaning to use the bathroom or shower. The doors are also pretty loud, and while the people staying around me were quiet and respectful of others, I could hear doors opening and closing from throughout the building. Toiletries and some essentials are not provided (bring your own hand soap and a lock for your locker), but the hostel is close to multiple convenience stores.I’d recommend staying here as long as you don’t have 5-star hotel expectations and know what to expect, especially if you don’t plan to spend too much time in your room. If you go in expecting the Ritz, you’ll be disappointed; the Chelsea International isn’t luxury by any means, but it’s a nice enough place to stay and rest!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

They were horrible and I would not wish anyone who wants to have a great memory of New York to go visit there. From their staff to manager, they were horrible. When I took a short moment to step away from my drink, they threw it away and then refused to make me the drink. Initially, I tried to be understanding, but they were the ones who treated me poorly. I even agreed to not have the drink and just for a refund of my drink for $21, and yet they also refused that. Push came to shove, and they offered me to chug down 3 shots instead. I said no, then they offered me a cheap margarita, but want to still charge me $21 for it. It was completely absurd and down right disrespectful.

Secondly, a lot of the rooms are dated - the TVs in the rooms I experienced did not have a streaming option, and the lack of armature in the King/Queen suites left a relatively uncomfortable viewing angle.   In the bathroom/rain showers, pieces of the walls were wearing and chipping from water damage, and our in-room menus and printed brochures were riddled with stains and worn paper.  The redeeming factor is the food and drink itself, one of the best meals I've had in-room in 20 years. Cocktails included.   From a partnership/Fine Hotels collection standpoint; a lot is left unclear and seems like an afterthought in comparison to other hotels in American Expresses collection. i.e. A lot of benefits were only explained verbally but not iterated on the printed materials (breakfast, limitations, etc.).

The first inconvenience occurred when we were directed to use a lift to reach the salle d'attente on the second floor, cue the PA struggling to fit my 15 piece matching set of Louis Vuitton luggage (and his back pack) into the rather tight elevator. I left the PA to carry out all the check in formalities, however I was rather flabbergasted to see him spinning a wheel as if he was some kind of game show host. It was then back to the elevator to reach our room on the 23rd floor, this is where problems started as all the lifts were full of other patrons; I instructed the PA that he would have to take the stairs with my 15 piece matching set of Louis Vuitton luggage. I eventually managed to get myself into an elevator after being told to go in sideways and not touch the sides. Obscenities began to be shouted towards the PA when he finally showed up to the 23rd floor because he hadn’t left me the room key, he then ushered me into the room which was rather diminutive. First thing I noticed was how cold the room was and I had visions of having to sleep in my morning dress, the PA found the thermoregulator and turned up the temperature; what a mistake that was at it sounded like the PA had started a diesel generator. For a quick dinner I allowed the PA fetch something called a “takeout” however he hadn’t picked up any silverware, I found some coffee stirrers in the room and we had to make do with those to eat the Mac’n’cheese (pasta and a cheese sauce). The beds were incredibly comfortable which resulted in both of us feeling very refreshed come dawn, this came in handy for the PA as due to the popularity of the lifts there was a wait so I demanded to be carried down the stairs (I don’t like burning calories unnecessarily). The gentleman on the ground floor was always very courteous and I tipped my top hat each time we passed. It was a little disappointing to find the housekeeper hadn’t cleared any of our detritus we’d left beside the receptacle, likewise the coffee stirrers weren’t replenished which resulted in the PA having a mac’n’cheese flavoured coffee. For our early flight from JFK I requested the PA to request a station wagon from reception, this was met with blank stares resulting in us vulnerable gentleman having to brave the conditions at an ungodly hour trying to flag down a cabriolet. Ultimately despite the few negatives our weekend retreat at the DoubleTree New York Downtown was pleasant and enjoyable, if the PA booked this boarding house again I would be fine with it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

Most places are a reasonable walking distance or short Uber rides to where you need to get to. The room was clean and serviced well daily.   Now the bad things, the staff were quite awful from the moment we arrived the check in process was unfriendly with no information provided and the staff were more interested in talking to each other than serving customers. It wasn't even busy as we were the only ones checking in at that stage. A bit of customer service asking about your trip what you were interested in, telling you about the hotel ..... nothing. Unfortunately that carried on throughout the stay and this hotel needs to train all their staff in customer service. I think the problem is supply and demand, as there is such demand they get filled without even trying and as such their staff just don't should any attitude to care. There were just stupid things like 3 of us staying and only two cups each day in the room, empty shower gel, towels not being left. Every day there was something we had to contact them about and the reaction we got wasn't apologetic either. The rooms are quite dated with peeling paint from the ceiling in our room, the heating sounded like you were beside a 747 at takeoff and only cold area was pumped out. This place needs a refurbishment to really bring it up to any decent standard.   One thing to be aware of as well is that if you book through a third party provider none of your Hilton Honors are considered, so you don't get anything benefits whatsoever. That came as a complete surprised and was hugely disappointing to a Diamond member. I think that policy stinks and is restrictive trading. Even after complaining Hilton just weren't interested, so am looking to switch loyalty given their behaviour over that. Even if you booked directly I'm not sure there is any benefit at this hotel, there is no executive lounge and you certainly don't feel that loyalty matters here. On hindsight I shouldn't have thought being loyal and booking to stay at Hilton was a good option especially when there were many better deals at other hotels and its a lesson learnt for me and one that will make me stop using Hilton as a result.  So in summary I would recommend other hotels, there is even a good Holiday Inn in the same road which was a better offer including breakfast and better rooms. Unless you are pushed for choice I wouldn't consider this place. I think a testimony to any stay is would you go back and from my experience I certainly won't be staying there again for any visit to New York. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

While a stay there is fabulous it is particularly wonderful to stay there during Christmas, Easter and Chinese New Year, as they make the hotel even more magical during for the holidays.  The location is the best.  It was a winter wonderland.  We loved the Victorian carolers, the sweet shoppe, Santa visits and the secret fairyland.  Decorations were divine.  We thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful spa pool, breakfast and Christmas eve dinner at Clement .

Rooms were a good size for NYC. One room minibar was not stocked on arrival, which caused charges to be added to the bill above what the $25 part of the amenity fee covered, but after viewing the bill on the tv and notifying the front desk, the extra was quickly removed. Great location for all things located near to the Times Square area, and next door to the subway for several lines.

This is not the hidden gem everyone raves about. Upon our arrival, the front desk clerk was ok - not super friendly, not rude - just whatever towards us. No big deal but certainly nothing to make us excited about checking in.  Once inside our double suite executive, we discovered it was not clean! Beds were made, couch spiffed up but bathroom was dirty with hair as were window ledges. I grabbed the phone to call the front desk and as I put it to my ear I discovered that the handset had been sitting in a puddle of beer! Had it not been such a long exhausting day of travel (from CA) maybe I would've noticed before touching it to my face but unfortunately, I did not. It left my hair and face smelling of stale beer. So gross. I asked the front desk for a sponge to clean the dishes (which we never got) and Clorox wipes (which they wouldn't provide). The front desk was apologetic & kind but the woman who came to re-clean seemed frazzled and still didn't remedy the bathroom. The next day my husband found a joint behind the window coverings in the living-room & I found a Sheraton key on a nightstand - making it even more apparent how inadequate the room cleaning had been.   At that point it didn't seem worth it to call them again b/c it was clear they wouldn't clean up to a higher standard so, we dealt with it and re-cleaned what we could. The uncleanliness is less than comforting in any stay but made worse since we had our young kids with us (5 & 8). The hotel said it was their \"busy season\" (12/26-12/31) and unfortunately, it may have been over-looked. I was less than impressed. We could already tell that they didn't real care about the issues so we stayed b/c truthfully, we didn't feel like battling with them over leaving.   Room size was generous and the building's location is WONDERFUL however, this location needs a lot of TLC & I wouldn't stay here again unless some changes are made. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

It was a close-in booking so I was thrilled to be able to get anything at all b/c we went for three nights a few days before Christmas.  I was not able to secure an upgrade.  It looks like this hotel has a very limited number of suites that they make available to members for upgrades.  For example, I look out at December of 2024 and they have no standard suites available at all...more than 11 1/2 months in advance.  Prior to arrival, I had corresponded with the concierge to request a rollaway bed for our room.  We arrived at the hotel late on December 20th.  We checked in and were told there were no rollaways for that night, or the following two nights of our stay.  When I mentioned that was fine but I had corresponded with someone (and named that person) the FD agent left to check on it, then came back and said the bed was already in the room.  Cool.  We were also upgraded to a room with a view.    When we entered, I was surprised at the size of the standard king room.  I have had some very small rooms in NYC and was expecting the room to be tight.  It wasn't.  It was a fairly standard sized room actually and the bathroom was very large.  The shower was a huge walk in, there was a tub in the bathroom, and the room with the toilet was also very large.  The bathroom had two sinks which is always a plus.  In not all that familiar with NYC, but we were facing toward Central Park and loved the view of the skyscrapers out the windows.  The room itself had a desk and plenty of closet space.  The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of outlets, including USB-C plugs, on either side of the bed.  We had one minor service issue.  The automatic curtains would not raise up in the bathroom.  This was mentioned when we left one morning and it was taken care of when we returned that afternoon.  We ended up eating breakfast all three mornings in The Living Room, and had dinner there two nights as well.  The food was all very good and the service was great.  We really enjoyed our stay here.  It was far enough from Times Square that the crowds weren't a problem, but it was close enough to easily get to Radio City or Rock Center by foot.  We would definitely look to stay here again in the future.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

It's right on 42nd street at second avenue. I thought it would be a very busy area. Instead, it was just perfect. Centrally located to tons of fine places to eat, to shopping, to transportation, to walking. If you like \"looking up,\" the building structures were dynamic and beautiful. Duck in for a hot chocolate at Zuckers. Have breakfast or lunch at one of the two closest diners (Townhouse and Gemini; we hit both). Head a block north or five or six blocks south to a meal or a hangout. You can get everywhere, so easily. Even back to LaGuardia, whether by Uber or taxi we did both).The hotel is beautiful. The staff goes out of their way to accommodate. There's a wonderful seating area to meet friends and hang out, across from a \"marketplace\" and bar where you can have a cocktail or heat up one of the food options in the microwave. The room was perfect. Totally updated. Oodles of storage... drawers, closet with cubbies and hanging space. The nightstand had a refrigerator! (We didn't discove that until we were ready to depart.) Bathroom was totally updated and easy. Lush, thick towels and plenty of them. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body lotion were upscale and plentiful. The dresser and desk were quite handsome with leather-look fronts drawers and vintage metal feet on the mid-century modern low chest. Plenty of charging stations for phones iPads, and hands-frees. Bed comfort was heavenly, like sleeping on a cloud. Our reservation let the hotel pick our room. When we checked in, we were told they had a king room available if we'd like (and we did).The staff went to great lengths to please. We'd intended to take Uber to the airport, and it was suggested we might wish to take a taxi. Chafik said he would be happy to get us a cab and a reputable ride. We went with that and it was perfect. Even a little cheaper than Uber would've been.My companion lost one of her favorite gloves and thought it might've been left in our room, or dropped in the lobby somewhere. We'd already checked out and checked our luggage to go to lunch. When we got back to hotel, Chafik said he'd gone up to our room to check for the glove (not there). Just going the extra mile was very special. (The companion then thought it might've been dropped/left at the bagel place up the street. That was correct and I retrieved.)Each time we entered or exited the hotel, the doorman opened the side door for us, or started the revolving door if we were headed that way. Staff was just wonderful. The room was comfortable, the bed was a great respite for hard-walking days. The hotel is centrally located, near Grand Central, and near the UN. In the middle of so many restaurants, stores. Second Avenue, First Avenue are a delight to walk along on the fashionable East side of manhattan in the East 30s and 40s. I'd love to stay at the Westgate ... again and again."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

I came to NYC right after hurricane Delhia hit Florida and I was supposed to check in Aug 30 but flights were canceled out of tampa. Priceline didnt want to give me the one day back and change reservation due to non cancelable. I called Lizbeth the manager at Radio hotel and she was so fantastic and understanding!! She gave me first night back and kept my reservation for the remaining stay. The room was absolutely beautiful n stylish with a great view of Washington heights. The comforters were so nice,comfortable and kept u really warm. Now Jessie the door man needs a shout out!!! Besides him being so nice n accommodating, my heel was coming apart and he literally went to his car and found me super glue!! It was so refreshing knowing that awesome people are still out there to help!!!! My flight wasn't leaving until 745pm and lizbeth let me have a late checkout til 1pm.. im so grateful to her!  The only thing I didn't like was there was no microwave in rooms and no where to heat up food. Also the fridge was really tiny you could barely put anything in it. For a great stay I would recommend this hotel for sure.. Thanks Jessie and lizbeth I had a wonderful time…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

The person checking us in \"Chantel\" was her name....  Pure gold.  She was super kind, friendly, accommodating and definitely had awareness of the situation which is crucial for a client facing role like hers.Location:  If you like to walk the location is awesome and we picked it partly for this reason.  It's smacked in the middle of anywhere you want to be in NYC, so most Lyft or Uber fairs were from $12-$30 to most anywhere around the city if you don't take the subway.Design:  If nothing else The Redburry has awesome style and design is well thought out.  I loved it.Not so good:  The first room we got the first didn't even have space for the suitcases...  the bathroom was literally bigger than the sleeping space.....  We upgraded to a Deluxe for the next 7 days.There were small things missing in rooms of a hotel of that caliber that were off putting....  Since I don't like to bother people even if I am paying this was a bit a fuss to have to go down or call room service for slippers, Tooth brush/paste, water.... hotel water....  There was also an added amenities fee if I'm not mistaken but.... I felt there were little to no amenities for this.Staff:  Like I said before \"Chantel\" was a godsend and the fact that it's the only name I remember says a lot ha....   I'd say 90% of the experience with the staff was brilliant and lovely.   There was one particular staff member that was not so friendly and made a fuss about us asking for water....  (Note we were staying at this hotel 8 days consecutively)...    This attitude I'd expect from a motel or a 7 Days in, but not a Chelsea $200-300night hotel...On that note please put Kettles in the room guys.... Atleast the Deluxe rooms should already have basic things already in the room like I mentioned earlier.Overall I'd say I had a great experience with a few small bumps but it's expected after staying so.many days right?   For 1-2 days I'd definitely stay again, but I need to stay for s week or longer I'd suggest staying somewhere else if you don't want to bother staff for small things over and over.Great experience overall!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

Food is in abundance-high end restaurants to budget; grocery store up the road, a little fridge in the room to store milk for that desperately needed caffeine shot in the morning (before bodily parts can function), subway access on just about every street corner within minutes, shopping (Macy's 10 minutes away- we arrived just in time to catch the Black Friday sales), Bryant Park where the Christmas markets had just started, a few bars with good drink selections.. and Madison Square Garden, also minutes away on foot.  We'd never been to an NBA game so managed to get tickets to a NY Knicks game at the \"Garden\" with the Knicks never looking like they were going to lose (to the Hornets!).  Caught a couple of musicals and TKTS seats (booked under the \"Red Stairs\" near Times Square were prime seats at significantly discounted prices-wouldn't get these seats at these prices in Aust!  We had a family room, travelled with our adult daughter (as a graduation present!) so the extra bed in the room did make it tight although given that we were mainly in the room to shower, sleep & recharge-  was adequate for our needs. The lift can be busy at \"peak hour\", only 2 lifts for the property so allow time especially if you need to check out and rush off to catch a flight-we were prepared so no dramas there.  Also, the reception staff were very helpful in ordering a car to the airport at a very reasonable price (without the hassle of trying to get a cab or Uber).

I relished my Loft Suite with a penthouse vibe and packed with a bevy of features: high ceilings with exposed brick, open concept footprint, hardwood floors and huge arched windows affording lots of natural light. A muted color palette with modern furniture, mirrors as big as walls and living, dining and workspaces added touches of hominess to the dwelling. The bath was marbleized and outfitted with a 2 person tub and a walk-in shower. Sartianos restaurant serves modern Italian food-fare with items that range from Yellowfin Tuna Tartare to Heirloom Beets to  Bomboloni. I scooped up the flavorful Octopus selection accompanied by some 'melt in your mouth' homemade Focaccia.  As a confirmed bookworm I loved the handsome library space in the lobby. Floor to ceiling mahogany bookshelves, curated weekly, are tended to much like a garden.  It's was such an pleasure for me to sip a Manhattan and flip through the libraries picks. Titles range from all over the place but it is my habit to look for titles out of the ordinary. There's a book for every interest..........so forget your computer...............and pack your reading glasses.

My friend and I booked it about a week in advance for 3 nights, and it was only about $40 each per night, which seems very reasonable for Manhattan. The hostel is located on the upper west side, right next to central park. The surrounding area was also great and had lots of shops, laundromats and places to eat so we had everything we needed. It's in a gorgeous and upmarket part of the city which tourists would probably not normally get to visit, so it was great to see a nice residential area. Staying here will make you feel like a proper New Yorker! We also had our own private room with bunk-beds, which was actually cheaper than just paying for a bed in a larger dorm (I think this was $50 a night per person). The room was nice and clean, and so was the communal bathroom. Although it may seem far from Times Square etc I actually preferred this as it was a lovely place to return to late at night in a very attractive location. The subway ride there is fairly short and the stop is about a 5 minute walk from the hostel. The staff were friendly and helpful and it felt very safe. There is a bar and outdoor area, however my only complaint is that there is no laundry room, as this is often essential for travellers. There is a laundromat one block away though so it isn't too much of an issue. I would definitely recommend staying here regardless of your budget as it feels far more authentic than staying in Times Square. Will definitely return for my next visit."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

The first week we were unfortunately in a small unit.  There was a window, but you could barely open it, and the view was of massive pipes etc. so all we really had, was some light coming through the window (which was sandblasted I think).  I've stayed at TMC twice before, both times thinking it was lovely, but this was an eye opener.  It was not the same anymore.  I had quite a shock when I opened the kitchen cupboard, to only find a few plastic plates, cups, glasses, and the little throw away sets of knives and forks!!  What!!  I phoned and asked what was going on, and finally got some decent crockery and cutlery brought to the room.  Then heard that these rooms, I think it was second floor, were called 'Metropolitan Suites', and it was standard!  Getting wifi was impossible, so we were finally given a gadget to carry with us for wifi.  We found the staff not very helpful, and even battled with our own luggage on the day we left!  For our second stay, we had a one bedroom unit with a lovely view on the 16th floor.  What a difference.  We were just back in NY from a cruise, and even though we were paying for a week, we only spent 2 days and 1 night there.  This time there was decent items in the cupboard.  We did have some help from the bell hop with luggage.  Front desk staff again not bursting with enthusiasm, and friendly and happy as with all the other places we stayed at during this overseas holiday.  I was really disappointed in TMC.  They have also had two hefty security deposits on hold on my credit card, and even though I've asked them to instruct their bank to remove the holds (after my bank said it was their responsibility to do do, even though they were telling me my bank should be doing it!), I still have one large hold.  They just don't seem to want to do anything themselves to remove these.I have always thought that this was a really lovely establishment, but this holiday has changed my mind.  The hotel is in an excellent area, has a good business centre, etc.  The one bedroomed unit was very good.  We often saw specials at the hotel, but always it was stated 'for owners', so we did not bother, seeing that we were not owners.  Is this because we had our reservations as exchanges through RCI??  By the way, the 'kitchen' in the small room was impossible!  You had to bend under the cabinet to open the tap.  In both rooms, the so-called kitchen is really nothing more than a fridge, microwave, sink, few odds and ends.  Getting lifts can also be a daunting task, you can wait forever.  Make sure you get your luggage to the foyer very early on the day of departure, as you could stand waiting at the lift for a very long time!Finally, STAY AWAY FROM THE 'METROPOLITAN SUITES'!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

While the hotel boasts a prime location near Times Square and a short walk to Central Park, as well as a beautiful lobby and smooth check-in experience, the overall stay was marred by dated accommodations.The hotel's proximity to Times Square and Central Park was undoubtedly a highlight, offering convenience and easy access to key attractions. The lobby was impressively adorned and the staff provided excellent service, even assisting us to our room with our luggage – a touch of hospitality that was appreciated.However, the experience took a turn upon reaching our assigned floor. The hallway seemed frozen in time, displaying a dated decor and a noticeable smell of dampness. Unfortunately, this theme persisted in our room. The accommodations were extremely old-fashioned, and the pervasive damp smell was off-putting. The radiators were inconsistent, with only one occasionally functioning.While we were primarily using the room for sleeping, it was disappointing to find it lacking in quality. Notably, other floors seemed to be undergoing or had undergone renovation, but our floor was an exception. The room fell short of the quality depicted in online images, leaving us somewhat disappointed.Despite these shortcomings, the staff's professionalism and assistance were commendable, showcasing a level of service that exceeded the room's standard. If only the same attention to quality were applied to the accommodations, The Manhattan hotel could truly live up to its potential.In summary, if you prioritise location and excellent service but are willing to compromise on room quality, The Manhattan might suit your needs. However, for those expecting a consistently high standard across all aspects of their stay, a thorough evaluation of room options might be advisable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

I think I was misinformed by all the reviews as most guests usually stay here for 1 or 2 days maximum. It is intolerable to stay here for so long as I did.

The room was quite dusty, the floor boards squeak all night and you can actually hear when the guest one floor above you flush the toilet. What really pissed me off was that they thought I was a homeless guy staying at the shelter since my stay was so long. I was so embarrassed and they even thought I was doing something illegal that they insisted I allow them into the room as I usually tidy up and sanitise everything especially when it comes to having a child. The housekeeping staff wipes everything in the toilet with the same wash rag: toilet bowl (inside of the rim of bowl), bathtub and face basin. I was so shocked. Clean everything yourself. Also there is an internet charge per day which when added to the nightly rate plus taxes work out to be more than staying at a Hilton or Doubletree chain of hotels. They also held a security fee for almost one week after my departure and it caused my credit card to go into over draft. I had to call them to release the funds.

So many shops/ cafes/ restaurants/ museums, etc, all within walking distance!  The staff were all very friendly and helpful; Jasmine and Xoshera were absolutely wonderful!!!

The staff are so friendly and courteous, and the location can't be beat. It's only a few minutes' walk away from Grand Central Terminal, Bryant Park, NYPL, and 5th Avenue. We initially booked a cozy/cabin room on their website, which was a bunk bed situation. For two adults, it felt cramped, and we asked if we could upgrade to a larger room. Keener was receptive to our request and managed to get us a free upgrade to a classic room, which felt more spacious and had room to sit (much needed after a ton of walking!) The staff also were accommodating of our request to hold our luggage after check-out so we could explore the area.Both rooms were clean and modern. The shower and sink were top-notch, with great water pressure. My main gripe was that most of the hooks in the rooms did not have stoppers at the ends, since the design was just a cylinder... so heavy coats and bags could slide right off. We managed to make do by rotating the standing mirror around, as there were metal bars on the back that could be popped out and used in lieu of hooks.We loved the option of free breakfast -- it seems like earlier in the morning, they have croissants (pretty good, with a nice crunch to them), and then they swap in for bagels later. They also provide filtered water and cups in the breakfast area.Overall, a lovely experience! Next time, I will book the classic or superior room :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

It was a busy weekend in December, and all of Midtown was packed.  Some of the guests in line were taking it out on the people working at the front desk, who were doing their best.   I am not sure how the people working check-ins were able to keep their demeanor based upon how they were being treated  - yes this is a 5 star hotel, but clearly they were slammed with dozens of people checking in at once.  Despite how busy it was, the woman checking me in was nothing but smiles as she searched for a room, unsuccessfully.   I told her to please not worry about it, I'd give her my phone number, and she'd contact me when the room was ready.    Meanwhile they took our bags, and we went for a cocktail nearby.   An hour or so later, our room was ready - not a big deal, not sure why others can't be more patient.   I'm not in NYC to hang out in my room.  Upon checking in, they acknowledged my Platinum Elite status and my birthday, and provided an upgrade.     The room was absolutely fantastic.  Very luxurious, with a wonderful view of 5th Avenue.   They also gave us a $100 hotel credit to make up for the tardiness of our room - much appreciated!  The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathrooms very posh, and immaculately clean.  This was honestly one of the best hotel experiences that I've had, and I've traveled quite a bit, also having stayed at 3 other different St. Regis properties.    The only thing that I would change is that the sole option for getting a cocktail in the hotel was at the Cole Bar, which ALWAYS had a long line to get in.  I am not going to wait 30+minutes to wait for a cocktail in Manhattan - plenty of other options, but I'm sure others would not mind.  Personally, I like to have something cozy and less trendy in the hotel I am staying in, but again - that's just a personal preference.    Finally, the location is great if you want to be in Midtown.   Of course, very touristy, but that's to be expected.  It's very convenient to the major sites this time of year, such as Rockefeller Center, Saks, etc.  I'm more of a downtown person but it was nice to stay in a different part of Manhattan for a change and a quick and easy subway or cab ride to escape.  In summary, thank you, St. Regis New York, for a memorable stay and treating us so well.   Well done.  …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

The lobby bar was really pleasant as was the rooftop bar (both separate businesses I believe).   I will say however that the ‘Resort Fee’ or whatever they call it of $36 a night is extortion and basically covers your wifi use and free long distance phone calls. It’s basically a tax avoidance scheme for Hotels who pay lower tax on these fees, and creates an artificially low price to attract customers. It’s basically just a shake down. We paid it because you aren’t give a choice really but apparently it’s illegal and you can make a complaint to the New York State Attorney General. You’re also within your rights to do a charge back on your credit card so bear this in mind if you want your money back.

Still modern and comfortable, the hotel met our every need. The rooms were spacious enough and we went for a basic one, the staff were also incredibly friendly and helpful offering lots of knowledge about the city. The absolute hidden gem is on the top floor, an observatory/lounge offering a nice atmosphere of peace out of the chaos of the city and great views outside, the Chrysler building in particular. It has a great coffee machine, and we saw plenty of guests enjoy the ambience with some drinks/food they had bought themselves (there's a small store right opposite). I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for those with needs similar to ours. My only feedback is you have to ask for housekeeping services, it isn't standard.

They refused to provide any accommodation and instead gave us a brochure with supposedly discounted hotels in the city. Faced with the uncertainty of 200+ people trying to secure a place, I quickly glanced at the brochure and decided on the \"Chelsea Inn\" due to its 3-star rating on the website.However, as I was en route to the hotel, I read the fine print and discovered two significant concerns: 1) The hotel had shared bathrooms, and 2) There was no reception. The latter worried me since I didn't have a US phone and hadn't received any confirmation from the hotel. Thankfully, upon arrival, I found someone at the front desk.Although the room itself was clean, I couldn't help but feel disappointed considering the price I paid. Private bathrooms should have been included at that rate. Additionally, having to carry my suitcase up five flights of stairs was quite inconvenient. The hotel's lack of luggage storage was another major drawback, especially for travelers with late flights. Furthermore, they charged an extra $35 for housekeeping, which thankfully I didn't require during my one-night stay.In conclusion, this hotel might be suitable for those who plan well in advance and receive check-in instructions on time. However, it should never be advertised as an option for last-minute bookings, especially for international guests who might urgently need a room. I can't imagine the trouble I would have faced if there hadn't been anyone at the reception upon my arrival."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

I wish I never booked a room here. No one should pay money to stay at this place. There were too many things wrong. Where do I even start?  1) The key had a hard time turning just to unlock the door. Things just went downhill from there. 2) The bedroom and bathroom were very dusty, almost as if no one had been there for years. There was also a smell of cigarettes even though there was a sign in the room that said it was a non-smoking room. 3) The sheets on the bed weren't clean, had stains, hair, and dust. The room didn't have a phone (or a clock) so I had to go downstairs to tell them that the sheets weren't clean. The guy at the front desk gave me \"clean sheets\" only for me to find out when I got back upstairs that even though those sheets were cleaner, they were still dirty with red stains.  4) The comforter was even dirtier and looked disgusting. One corner of it had a big yellow stain resembling urine. 5) Even though the windows were closed, you could still feel a draft of cold air coming in so the room was very cold and not much heat was provided throughout the night.  6) The (dirty) ceiling near one of the 2 windows had water dripping from it. 7) There was a small roach on one of the bathroom towels.  8) The bathroom sink drains so slow that I had to floss and brush my teeth in the shower.  9) The shower head was really dirty, but to be fair most hotels don't seem to clean this. I actually took the filthy shower head off just to shower. 10) The wall outlets were practically useless. Anything that you plugged into them usually fell right out just seconds later. So I couldn't charge my phone. 11) You can hear quite clearly when anyone in a room next to yours is talking. Doesn't matter if you're in the bedroom or in the bathroom, you can still hear them. The people next to my room stood up most of the night talking just adding to my frustration of all the problems the room already has. And to make it worse people were slamming doors incredibly loud between 11pm to about 3am. 12) Hotels.com told me that checkout was at 12 noon. That wasn't true, checkout was at 11am. 13) Some rooms had no bathroom. Mine did, which is probably the only positive thing I can say about it.  There were more issues. But those are the ones I remember at the moment. As if all those things alone weren't a major turn off, the dirty sheets and comforter is completely unacceptable. The primary reason people stay in a hotel is to have a place to sleep in for the night and if everything on the bed is nasty, how are you supposed to sleep on that? This place should either fix all of it's issues or shut down their business. It's not worth the money or time to stay at this hotel. Hotels.com should de-list it from their search results. I feel cheated. Stay away!!!…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

It was a cheap hotel, I was expecting a basic room without anything extra and during my stay that's what I got. However, I had to pay a deposit before checking into the hotel in cash. I'm used to it being on credit but no big deal. After checking out they said I would have to wait a few days and then call them to get my deposit mailed back to me. Strange but I understood. They have to check the room, make sure I didn't break anything. That's the last I saw of that money.I call multiple times after about my deposit, and each time I was told the office was closed and to call back later. No specific time was ever given of course but each time I called back it was the same excuse. After a month of this they said that they probably don't have my deposit anymore so I escalated my call to the booking site Expedia. When they called them the hotel said that I, quote \"did not return the key to the staff after the guest checked out and the accommodation has to change the lock and produce new sets of the keys and the cost for this process was $135.00Therefore the guest still obligated to pay for the remaining cost of changing the lock and producing new keys.\"This was a lie. I handed the key directly to the front desk employee who checked me in the first night and there is probably security footage showing that. Unfortunately I didn't record myself handing the key to front desk as I was not expecting my deposit to get stolen and for them to lie about it. With no way to prove that I didn't have the key (how was I supposed to prove I didn't have an item I don't have?), that they lied about making a new key and changing the locks, or anyway to access the security footage proving I handed them the key back, I basically had my $120 stolen.There's little I can do about this other than warn other people away from staying at this hotel.

There are so many cons.1.  I booked a one bedroom suite with one bed and a sleeper sofa for 2 adults and 1 child.  I booked this same type of room at another NYC hotel and had no issues.  When I returned to my room and pulled out the sleeper sofa, it was an unmade mattress.  I called to state that the sleeper sofa had no linen and was asked if I requested it to be made.  I didn't think I would need to if the room was booked for 3 persons and there as only one true bed.  I didn't need to do so at the other hotel.  It is 11 pm at this time.  35 minutes later a staffer knocks and hands me linen.  No plan on them dressing the bed.  He stated, oh we can send someone up to do it.  I said that would be nice. 30 minutes later, no one arrived, so I started to make the bed myself only to discover that the linen was not sufficient to make the bed and have linen for coverage of someone sleeping.  A flat sheet and pillows.  I called downstairs again.  Was told they would send me more linen.  30 more minutes past and no one comes.  Now it is 12:30 am.  I go to the front desk to discuss this issue and an issue detailed below.  The front desk person was condescending and rude.  Telling me I needed to tell him what specific pieces of linen I wanted.  I didn't know what fit that bed and how they make them (duvet, cover sheet, spread, fitted sheet ???) as every hotel is a bit different.  He went to get a manager who came from the back and said he would personally deal with my issues and bring me appropriate linen.  By 1:10 am no one had still come.  I eventually put the flat sheet they provided on top of the mattress, put on my day clothing with socks and a sweater (because I had no linen to cover up with)  and went to bed.2.  The hotel has quiet hours from 10pm to 5 am.  While dealing with the above issue the next door hotel guest were allowing their children to scream, yell, bang on the walls.  I let it go until it was after midnight and I was on my way to the front desk.  I knocked on their door and asked politely if they could be a bit quieter.  I was told they were celebrating a birthday, and I could call security if I had a problem with it.  So while I was at the front desk, I told them about the noise from that room.  The front desk staff said they would address the noise level.  They never did.  The hotel is not responsible for the actions of others but they are responsible for addressing it.  Once again they did not address an issue of concern.  The noise continued.3.  The TVs in our room had no sound.  Picture was fine, but no sound regardless of  what we did to try to fix the situation.4.  When I went to call the front desk, the phones in the room were dead.  I had to call the front desk with my cell phone.5.  There is resort/hotel fee that was to include Hop on Hop Off tickets.  Stated on the website and told at check in.  Went to obtain them the next morning and was told they didn't renew their contract with the Hop on Hop Off company, so there were no tickets.6.  The room had a microwave but no refrigerator.  Weird and useless to have a microwave without a refrigerator.7.  Extremely busy and crowed hotel.Pros:Not far from the theaters.  Other than that, there aren't any other pros.Not a place I will want to stay in again when in New York.   I complained when I checked out about my stay.  The front desk person went to talk to a manager.  The manager never came out.  The front desk person stated I would be awarded points.  Points!  What if I weren't a Marriott member?  The points weren't sufficient for the crappy night.  There are far better Marriott hotel in NYC that everyone should use rather than here.

Also, if you are reading this review because you want to stay close to the station, Hampton Inn is within a few blocks from Grand Central. It is an easy walk as well. The room itself is clean and spacious by New York standards. Everything worked in the room. The complimentary breakfast was adequate, and it is a plus especially if you travel with your family.

My family stayed at The Leon for five nights in early August 2022. I had arranged for the stay due to the location and the website photos. The room was nice enough, and quite clean. However, the service was spotty at best. Some days we got toiletries, some days not. Some days we got enough towels, some days not. I went to the front desk to ask to borrow a bottle opener and the attendant was completely baffled by the request. They evidently skip those basic amenities that other hotels have been providing for decades. This was all fine. We are not complainers, even though the price we paid was about average for our one or twice yearly trip to New York. The real problem arose upon checkout. The hotel is located at an unusual intersection so before leaving we asked where best to catch a cab. We got a dismissive reply that provided very little in the way of useful information. Any other hotel would have offered to arrange for a car. We left the premises and spent 15 or 20 minutes in extreme heat unsuccessfully attempting to get a cab (no more than 3 or 4 even passing in that time). My husband decided to return to the hotel and ask them to call a cab for us. For reasons unknown, this resulted in the gentleman behind the desk exploding. He began shouting at my husband and verbally abusing him. It was truly a shocking and bizarre experience. We travel extensively and this was perhaps the poorest customer service we have encountered. Don't be deceived by the quaint photos - The Leon Hotel is anything but welcoming.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

The issues that are consistent across most of these reviews are indeed present.

It used to be an Andaz, which means the rooms are massive, the finishes are quite nice, and it feels more elevated. That said, none of it has been maintained.   As noted in other reviews, the shower floods the entire bathroom, and I had unresolved HVAC issues, including AC that just didn't work, throughout my stay. The room was very poorly maintained - scuff marks all over the walls and the bathroom and chipped tiles, knobs, and furniture. Housekeeping was a miss - the room wasn't the cleanest when I got in, and the room was barely turned when housekeeping came by.   The gym is \"not working\" (not clear what that means) and they send guests to an apartment building next door, but I didn't use it and am unsure how it works.

That's all I can say good about it. The cost for this dump was nearly $300 for one night stay. The lady checking us in was a real grump. Our room on the 4th floor was barely enough room for the queen size bed. On two sides of the bed, you had to walk sideways because it was so small. We had to place our bags on the bed to get our clothes out because there was no room anywhere else. The room was a fire trap with barely enough room to get out. The fire alarm went off because of a malfunctioning toaster in the lobby sent smoke all the way up the building triggering alarms. The waffle maker wouldn't give up the waffle when cooked and the rest of the breakfast offerings was pitiful. Not sure if all rooms were the same.

It may seem affordable, but might end up costing you extra. We booked our stay several months in advance and requested for a quiet room. The hotel's idea of a quiet room was next to rooms they started to renovate. It was not a light face lift but a total gutting of rooms and bathrooms. Who wouldn't want to be waken up at 8 in the morning to the sound of a jackhammer during their vacation, right? So basically the room was unusable during the day because of the construction noise. We tried to change rooms, but it wasn't possible as they said they were fully booked, meaning they didn't have similar rooms available. Had we changed to a \"better room\", we would have had to pay that rate. The options given were to have a refund and check out the same day or stay in the same room with a slightly lower rate. Now what is the likelihood that you are able to find accommodation in New York at short notice and a similar rate you got 6 months ago. Zero. So the refund really isn't a fair option. Also a 24% discount isn't fair when forced to wake up ridiculously early and not be able to use the room for a good part (1/3) of the day. You can get a 25% discount in most hotels without any issues. But this was the best they could do. Unbelievable.Also communication was extremely painful. The front desk cannot make any decisions. The manager has to check everything with a director who is never to be seen. Basically no one is taking responsibility and everyone is going behind someone else's back. It's not me, it's the other person higher up in the food chain. The simplest solution would have been to delay the start of the reno every day for like 2 hours, but that turned out to be impossible. The reno crew was untouchable. No one could make that decision. So ended up changing hotels. We knew service in New York is horrible, but this was next level. Don't believe their marketing and mile long messages about how they care about their customers. You need to go somewhere else to get what this hotel advertises."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

My rating is based on her actions.  You couldn’t beat the location for what our family likes to do. MOMA is across the street for instance. Central Park is five blocks away. Shopping, restaurants, Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, all walkable.   Although our rooms were tired, the hotel staff was courteous, helpful and professional. Even the parking staff was great, which hasn’t been our experience in other NYC hotels. The hotel breakfast buffet was surprisingly good.  We requested a room on a higher floor which was very quiet and the wait times for the elevator weren’t bad.

At one instance, there was only 1 person at the Front Desk, and she was answering all the calls and helping many people alone.  The hotel room entry was weird and not clearly marked, so it initially took a few minutes to figure out our room entrance in the floor hallway.  We booked a suite, but it was a very small room.

We had a Premium Room (1502) which was a nice surprise and plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 children.  It had great views towards the Hudson River.  Arrival was around 7pm on Saturday evening and we'd taken the AirTrain/Long Island Railroad from JFK, getting off at Penn Station which was a five minute walk.   The location of the hotel is excellent - 10 minutes to the heart of Times Square.  Lots of eateries nearby.  We tried the Tailor pub which was very good, plus Liberty Bagels which was amazing!  Walking everywhere is possible given the location and we walked to Central Park in around 25 minutes. The Circle Line is about 15 minutes walk and Empire State/Macys just under 10 minutes.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the location and room we had.  The street it is on has a Police station, so very safe, however it has scaffolding/construction, so feels a little run-down.  We didn't eat here, so can't comment on that, but did have a drink in the hotel bar which was handy and reasonably prices ($10 for a beer).  The staff also held our luggage on the last day so we could go sightseeing - there is now no charge for this, which is new as it used to be $5 apparently.  The only issue we had was with the elevators - there was a fault that meant the elevators stopped at every single floor when you went up and down - being on the 15th floor meant this was not ideal.  This was from Saturday and only got fixed on the Tuesday evening.  A fault like that should be fixed in no more than 24 hours in my view.  It led to lots of people waiting in the Lobby to go upstairs so not ideal.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this hotel , despite all the good reviews on here, the management has got to learn how to deal with customers complaints . I paid over $300 per night for the room without breakfast and in addition there is a resort fee, which is effectively a tax and another way the hotel makes money out of their customers. When we arrived at reception the receptionist explained the resort fee to me and stated that this was for coffees, teas, and water in the room as well as Internet and the Spa?. In the room there was only 2 small tea bags and two creamers so I requested more which they obliged. Next day i  requested some more creamers as two was not enough. The receptionist said that they would bring some to the room. After 45 mins i phoned back down and inquired where the creamers were as we wanted a cup of tea after walking around NY all day, only to be told that housekeeping had stated that each room was only allowed 2 creamers a day and we already had that so therefore we were not allowed any more, i assumed they were joking , but was told this is the rules. I confirmed , that the resort fee of $16 covers this and they stated it did , however you are only allowed 2 creamers a day , despite them not replenishing the water( which is also included in the resort fee) that day . I expressed my disappointment and they told me the manager would contact me. Pete the manager phoned me and explained that he had spoken to Housekeeping and these are the rules and you are only allowed 2 creamers a day per room.I confirmed with him , that the resort fees are for these amenities and he agreed but made a big statement how the Internet (which in almost every other hotel in the world is free) is also covered by this resort fee. He agreed on this occasion that he would allowed 5 creamers ( but only delivered 4) but from the next day onward we would only be allowed 2 creamers per day. I find this pathetic and bad management , and shows the hotels attitude of squeezing money out of their customers, and customers feelings doesn't matter .

We waited at least 25 minutes while the manager called around to find us a 'comparable type' room. Once at the alternate hotel, it was far from Mid-town where we had wanted to be, it was loud and dirty and had only double beds (not comparable to the queen beds we had reserved). When we returned the next day for the second nights' stay, the receptionist politely checked us in but there was no amount showing on the credit card machine (not his fault), when we asked what the amount would be, we were told a price that was about $100 more than our original reservation. We showed him the printed reservation which was made directly through the Marriot website, not a 3rd party, and the price was changed but had we not asked, we would have been very surprised when we got our credit card bill!To be fair, and why I gave only a 'poor' rating instead of a 'terrible' rating, our night at the alternate hotel was paid for, the one night at this hotel was refunded and our taxi to & from the alternate hotel was paid for.

I cannot thank enough Raquelle who helped me booked my last minute reservation, Yovanny who always greeting you with the smile at the front desk and ensuring I have a great room available to check in, and bellhop Shawn for holding my coffee while I fish out my laptop charger out of my luggage. They all made my recent stay so very special that I cannot wait to come back again!…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

The location is very good, only a 5 or so minute walk to Central Park and subway stations at the end of the street. I noted others saying it felt unsafe on the street, I didn't experience this, it's in a busy area and as 'safe' as most places in Manhattan. The hotel was still undergoing refurbishment work so not all communal areas were open, however it did seem to have more available than in recent months where others cite there was almost nothing available.  We had a really strong welcome to the hotel which I always feel is important. Having made a few basic requests to the room, despite arriving late in the day for some reason it wasn't quite ready or the staff wanted to be absolutely sure we were well accommodated. Even though the delay was brief, we were immediately whisked to the lovely bar for a complimentary drink of our choice off the menu, before the staff member came back to tell us everything was ready.  The room was well sized for New York, we had a basic twin room but there was a seating area, it didn't feel too cramped and it was modern. The bathroom was also nice, a decent shower and lighting, with premium toiletries. I was really not a fan of the shower curtain though, I always find these grubby and unhygienic in hotels. There didn't seem to be a fan either so the mirror very easily steamed up. The air con in the room was very good, not too loud yet powerful. There were no tea or coffee facilities in the room which was disappointing. Beds were comfortable and the rooms weren't noisy, with good blackout blinds to aid sleep. Note that some rooms apparently don't have locks on bathroom doors so beware if staying with friends/colleagues if you value privacy. Also, twin rooms were only available in a small size.  The gym in the hotel was quite big, a decent amount of equipment and also had a large studio with additional weights, mats and a number of Peloton bikes. I enjoyed using this most mornings. It involves a slightly awkward route, exiting the front of the hotel and going into another entrance where there's a blow dry and beauty bar down a very slow lift. The gym was exclusive to the hotel, I imagine when renovations are finished there will be an internal lift down there.  The bar was visually appealing but some of the cocktails were hit and miss. Service was always good but things could be slow, ordering breakfast one day was a frustrating experience as we waited ages. It was also incredibly expensive, no surprise for NY (everything seems to have gone up in price by about 20% since my last visit a few years ago) but a basic breakfast for 2 ending up costing $120 with tip and service, which was laughable.  The hotel offered a What's App service which made requesting anything a breeze. If toiletries were running low or you wanted additional towels, or needed your room serviced at a specific time, they were quick to respond, always delivered and staff at every level couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.  Upon check-out they weren't that keen to engage with us or ask how the stay was, rather the staff member who helped us store our bags was particularly perturbed that we didn't tip him.   Overall, it's a lovely hotel, well-located and I look forward to seeing what it's like when the final renovations are done and scaffolding is removed. It's hard to find a modern premium hotel in NY with decently sized rooms so I would happily stay again. The only thing is despite personally getting a competitive rate through a travel agent, the prices are really high to stay there-£500-600 a night which is really quite exorbitant for a 4* hotel.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

Although the location was good for walks to Central Park, Times Square or 5th Avenue shopping, we encountered some significant issues during our stay. Most notably, they deducted from my credit card a $500 smoking fee for no reason. I informed the hotel that we do not smoke and that we are willing to take any nicotine (or other) test to prove this fact. They said that won't be necessary, but then did not refund me, and ignored subsequent communications from us on this topic. Other (less serious) issues were iffy wi-fi, offline elevators forcing long wait times for service elevators, strange aircon settings that only provided heating, and very limited on-premise eating options. Based on the location, I could maybe still have suggested this hotel to others, but the smoking fee was the last straw. It feels like an unfair/dishonest additional charge that was simply levied to boost profits. I therefore DO NOT recommend staying at this hotel. If you have no choice, then factor in the arbitrary smoking fee that they might be adding to your room fee.

I’ve stayed here twice a year for about 7 years (not during the pandemic, obviously) and always been satisfied.  In the past:  interactions with staff have been positive; rooms, though very small, are functional and clean; although bathrooms are shared I can’t recall having to wait to use a toilet, shower or sink; the location is ideal for access to West Village, Chelsea, Whitney Museum, walks along the Hudson River, etc.; the rates have always been reasonable; and the Jane has a quirky, shabby chic charm that is missing from sterile chain hotels.  My recent 6-night visit was a major disappointment after years of being pleased.  Construction is taking place which is extremely disruptive.  Just some examples of unpleasant conditions:  • There was only one working bathroom on the 4th floor since the other one was sealed off, meaning 2 toilets, 2 showers and 2 sinks were to be shared by guests in the 40+ rooms on the floor.  Several mornings and evenings it was necessary to wait for a toilet and/or shower being used by other guests.  • Three separate instances during the daytime when it was necessary to wait while construction workers used toilets and sinks.  One of those times I had to wait for 3 workers who were washing up at what was apparently the end of their shift, using loads of toilet paper to dry their freshly washed faces.  Why aren’t there aren’t facilities or portable toilets assigned solely for workers?  • The website states that work takes place between 8 AM and 5 PM and will have “minimal impact” but one morning a loud grinding noise from within the bowels of the building started at 7:12 AM.  • Signs clearly state that the front entrance and the elevator are for guest and staff use only.  Returning from an early morning run the sidewalk and stairs were nearly impassable with construction workers standing and sitting blocking the front entrance.  Several times I shared the elevator with construction workers, once with 2 guys who got on at the third floor each with a large garbage can full of debris.  In fairness, other times when workers saw that a guest was on the elevator they said that they would wait.  It may seem like I’m a snob but the elevator is small and as a paying guest I don’t want to be up close and personal with a dirty/dusty worker hauling trash.  • Photos accompanying this review show just some of the construction evidence that you pass on the way to your room on the fourth floor.  Without reviewing credit card receipts from previous stays, I do believe that the rates I paid during this visit were more than I’ve ever paid and the stay was, to be blunt, extremely disappointing.

Great location, staff is nice, good view of the city, and the room is clean--if a bit smaller than expected. The problem for me was the paper thin walls.

When I called to ask for a different room I was told that the people in the room next to me were very nice regulars, as if it was my problem, so I didn't bother calling again when confronted by the problem the next night. To be fair, the neighbors weren't being too loud, the walls are just too inadequately insulated. The shame of it for me is that I will be traveling to NYC regularly for the next couple years and was very excited when I learned about the Edge in Washington Heights.

It truly has no redeeming qualities as both the rooms and service are horrendous. The staff is rude and cannot be bothered to, not only do their jobs but, act remotely human. Do not expect anyone to acknowledge you or assist you here.    Our trip started off on the wrong foot when we checked-in. We approached the front desk/reception and two individuals behind the desk were talking. When we got there, they looked at us, stared, and then kept on with their conversation. When one of them was ready (I think her name was Fran), she looked up and gestured us to the desk. She did not say \"hello\" or \"good morning\" and just asked for the name the reservation was under. We were early for check-in and knew that we likely would not be able to get a room right away, but we asked if she could give us an estimate and she said she wouldn't and that we should assume that it will be after the normal check-in at 3:00 because they were busy that day (never mind that it was in the middle of the week and we were the only ones in the lobby at the time). She also said that they do not have a queue, so we can call and check periodically if we wanted to. This was unusual as other hotels usually take down names and numbers and call guests when rooms are available, as a courtesy. Nonetheless, we asked if there was a particular number we should call and she told us to look up the phone number on the website. She had zero interest in hospitality or just being a nice person. After that encounter, we left the hotel and, about an hour later we called and another individual told us that they had several rooms available and we could come back and check-in. Had we not called, we would not have checked-in until about 6 hours later.   Once we checked-in, we went up to the room. While the hotel lobby and bar are decent, the hallways and rooms of this hotel can only be described as dark and dingy. The hallway is poorly lit and the carpet in the hallways and rooms looks like it has not been vacuumed or cleaned in years.   Our room was a \"premium queen.\" There was nothing \"premium\" about this room. It was small, but that is not the issue we had with it as that is typical for most NY hotels. The carpet (again) was disgusting. The room was so poorly ventilated that the air inside was thick. The AC was set at 77 degrees and it could not be changed. The ventilation was so bad that when we took a shower, the room smelled like mildew because the bathroom did not have a fan or a window that opened. Our towels never dried because of the moisture that was consistently in the bathroom and room for the four days we were there. We had to open the door to the room to let some \"fresh\" air in from the hallway and let the moisture out. It would get so hot in the room that we would go into the hallway just to cool down.   The bathroom was another disaster. The toilet was not properly secured to the ground and wiggled when you sat on it. The handle also leaked every time we flushed. The shower only had a curtain that barely did anything to keep the water in. So, between the leaking toilet and the shower, the bathroom floor always had puddles of water that we needed to clean up. The shower curtain also contributed to the dampness and mildew-smell as it never dried. Also, there was no thought put into the bathroom. The space is understandably small, but a little thought into additional hooks or shelves so that guests can properly hang their clothes or place their toiletries goes a long way. I have stayed in smaller hotels in Europe where the function of the small rooms is incredible.   Lastly, to top everything off, we found a cockroach in the bathroom. Sadly, I wasn't surprised by this cockroach and I was more surprised by the fact that there weren't more in the room considering how dirty and dingy everything was.   To say the least, we could not wait to check out and leave, which is a feeling I have never had in NY or any other place I have stayed at. It is extremely disappointing to stay at a place that has zero sense of hospitality and clearly does not care about upkeep, all the while paying over $400/night. This hotel is not even that old, so why management has just completely given up is beyond me.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

It was a not-so-good memory maker. But, now, it was great. The upgrades are done correctly and the stay was perfect – well, almost perfect.We stayed in a king bed room on the 8th floor. Bathroom and shower were small but efficient. The shower was so good we didn’t want to get out- but cut it short to save water. The décor is white and more white which is a good choice because the rooms are still kind of small but we only sleep there so no problem. Bed was very comfortable,  small closet, little desk and a decent TV. The phone was a little confusing- not that we sued it, but the message light came on twice and we had no idea how to listen to the messages but anyone actually looking for us would call our cell phone anyway so not a deal breaker. The price was very affordable but 2 days later, with Thanksgiving, the prices would have been more.It is, very close to the Empire State Bldg. which if we craned our necks at our window, we could actually see some top floors and the spire) – also close to Macy’s, etc. Koreatown is outside the door so lots of selections for food and more coffee shops than I can recall. Also easy walk to theaters, Rockefeller Center, and not too bad a walk to Central Park. We like to walk.  No discernable street noise while we were there on the 8th floor which is pretty amazing. The lobby was nice but the bar and café were not open yet. We didn’t care. They did have a coffee / tea set-up there in the morning but this is not a B&B.All the staff from the lobby staff to cleaning folks were just really nice and polite. Great job!Ok- the one non-perfection item: walls are, apparently, thinner than one would expect in such a historic buildings. We say this because someone in a room adjacent to ours had a couple of major curse-laden meltdowns which woke us up. Not a big enough deal to complain, just rude behavior.

The overall experience was mediocre, and there are several pros and cons we would like to share.Pros:Location - that is the main reason why we picked this hotel. It is a minute away from the subway line 6 station, ~5 mins walk from the Empire State Building / Koreatown, and ~15 mins walk from the Penn station. So it is very convenient to visit different places via public transportation or get delicious authentic Asian food.Staff - the hotel staff at the concierge and cafe are friendly and helpful. Even it was the busiest season during the year, they were nice enough to provide the help as much as they can. We arrived at the hotel much earlier than the expected time, but the lady at the concierge was still able to check us in. We also had some great conversations with the cleaning crews. Pet friendly policy - we were traveling with our little dog, and the hotel policy allowed her staying with us. There was a $150 fee for the entire stay, which is a common and reasonable price in NYC.Cons:Room - we booked a standard Queen room, but we were astonished by its size once opening the door. It was extremely small (200 sqft at most) even for the standard of NYC, and we did not have enough room to place our luggage or even walk freely. There was no view from the window, and the room was so dark that we had to turn on the light all the time during our stay. The pictures of the rooms provided by the hotel were not close to the reality.Elevator - there are two elevators in the building. But one of them is used exclusively by the service crew, which means all the guests on the entire ten floors need to share one elevator. There were multiple times that we spent prolonged time waiting for the elevator. You can choose to use the stairway instead, but the stairs are steep and somehow sketchy.Dinning service - the complementary breakfast was included for our stay. The barista at the cafe was nice and friendly, but the dining experience was poor which is related to how the cafe works. When we ordered food at the cafe, the barista had to contact with the kitchen upstairs, and goes upstairs to pick up the food when it was ready amid preparation of hot drinks for other guest. The waiting time can be ridiculously long during the rush hour. The quality of food was actually decent, but it was just unacceptable to wait 40 minutes for a tuna salad sandwich.Overall, our experience at HGU New York has been a disappointment. We understand that the hotel has done their best to accommodate as many as guests during the Christmas, but the amenity of the hotel needs some substantial improvement. We would not recommend it if you are traveling with a big family, or for an extended period of time. To note, HGU New York was under the “small luxury hotel” brand, but you would only expect the first half of it as it has nothing to do with anything luxury."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

My partner and I weren't sure how it would be since it rebranded as the Hyatt Centric.

She surprised us by upgrading us to the Centric Suite. I have elite status with Hyatt, and had not never had such a surprise like this in awhile, as I'm just a discoverist. When I walked in the room I was shocked, a beautiful suite overlooking wall street, with everything we needed for our stay was in the room. It was such a great night and amazing we ended up extending for one more night! When I went to check out for the first night and speak to them about extending our stay to my surprise yet again, Kassie had already put us in for a late checkout making it a much smoother and easier transition to extend.  We are leaving today but if it wasn't for Kassie and the whole team down at the Hyatt Centric Wall Street this stay would not of been such a smooth process and amazing experience.

A cocooned window seating area was neat but the pinnacle amenity was the wall of floor-to-ceiling windows affording lots of natural light and superior vistas of the cityscape.

The sultry Bar Pendry is a classic waterhole where I enjoyed small bites and handcrafted drinks ......like the Moscow Mule.....kicked like a mule. The Garden Room is a casual relaxing space serving small bites, daytime coffee and evening cocktails. Zou Zou's, a well respected eatery, serves Eastern Mediterranean food-fare the likes of Duck Borek and fire roasted Leg of Lamb. I selected the Octopus Carpaccio, Smoked Cherry Baby Lamb Chops, Lemon Frozen Yogurt and Prosecco to wash it down.........a terrific food collage. Chez Zou is a premier cocktail lounge with unusual pairings like Bananas & Bourbon and Vermouth & Picked Cucumbers and others.

Because it was a work trip, I set the bar for my lodging expectations fairly low:  I need a private bathroom, a comfortable bed, good wifi to get work done, and some way to acquire breakfast (either within the hotel, or very close by).  That's it.  And while I *technically* did experience these things (which is why this is not a one star review), the quality of each was so sub-par, I wound up shortening my trip and checking out out early.  My sliding shower door barely slid and required significant force (and I say that as someone who is 5'10\" and works out regularly).  The toilet handle was not attached to the tank, and was just hanging out the side.  The pillows were each so flat, I could ball one up and grip it in my hand.  Good luck with breakfast if you don't eat meat or are trying to limit carbs.  And the clincher--that is the worst wifi connection I have experienced in YEARS.  Oh, but wouldn't you know it, for $5, I could have a \"premium\" connection; I shouldn't have to pay extra to simply browse the internet and respond to emails.  I couldn't *function* in this room.  I could look past the occasional cosmetic issues--inexplicable stains on the mirrors, chipped furniture, etc (I don't think anyone staying here is expecting luxury), but there were enough to notice that collectively, the room felt very worn and tired.  I found the staff cold (with the exception of one maintenance worker I kept bumping into), with zero acknowledgement that I was a Hilton Honors member (I should note that I personally don't need this acknowledged, but in the after-stay survey I was emailed, this was a detail about which they asked).  When I checked out early, the woman at the front desk was visibly confused, asked another employee for assistance, who curtly and without any eye contact or acknowledgement that something might be amiss to require the early departure, simply said, \"yeah, it's fine.\"  No goodbye, no thank you, nothing.  Just, \"ok, that's it.\"  There are two other hotels on this block, and when I return for the same work event next year, I will be staying elsewhere.  I was willing to spend an additional $125 to move my flight early just to avoid staying in this hotel any longer than I had to.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

I am not a New York expert in any way shape or form and there are obviously a LOT of hotels there, so I spent quite a long time looking for the right place.  I think the first choice most of us have is what budget we have to spend.  Do you want to spend USD200 - USD400 to stay in a Hilton, Omni,  Sheraton etc type of hotel, USD400 to USD600 to stay somewhere a step up from that or USD600+ to stay in one of the best hotels.  If you are taking that first step up and pay more than the standard then the hotel has to be worth it and I think the Pendry was!  My reasons why are below:-  Location - This was one of the most important factors for me.  Once again I am not a NY expert but I kind of figured out that most of the things I would want to see, places to go shopping or restaurants to go eat were somewhere between Washington park and the bottom of Central Park.  Given that there would be some days I might not want to walk or get the metro but get an Uber I wanted somewhere that was sort of in the middle of that area and therefore accessible via Uber (which is very expensive!).  The second thing was that reading reviews on here people would complain about coming out of their hotel around Times Square/Midtown and being met by sights they did not want to see….The Pendry is in a quiet, clean street with high class offices and a business square behind it so was basically in a perfect and safe location.  Room - As we weren’t planning on spending lots of time in the room it didn’t matter to us to book a luxury room.  We stayed in the standard room which was spacious, tastefully decorated, with a nice view over the office square behind the hotel.  The shower was powerful and constantly hot.  The room was clean on our arrival and well cleaned during our stay there.  The room was also quiet, the bed was large and comfortable and the black out curtains cut out the light and the air conditioning was perfect so you could have the quality sleep there that you would expect from a hotel this level.  The rest of the hotel - We didn’t chose to eat in the hotel and didn’t use any of the facilities really but the gym was big and it had a couple of nice looking bars that would have been good to have a late night drink in.  Given the huge choice of places to eat in NY, perhaps the hotel could think a little bit outside of the box to incentivize guests to go and eat at the restaurant…  The service/staff - We aren’t demanding/fussy guests so had limited interactions with the staff other than at check in where Violet was very nice and efficient and managed to find us a room when we arrived early which was hugely appreciated and at check out where Luis was super professional and just left us with a great final impression.  The hotel also took a few different deliveries for us and held and delivered all of them for us efficiently and professionally.  My experience was that for the price band you pay for the Pendry there is nothing I could really fault the hotel for and did not regret spending the extra.  I would definitely stay there again and wish the hotel and all the staff there huge continued success!…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

No decor, side tables, chairs or even bedside lamps. You get a small sofa, a coffee table, a tv  and a bed - thats it. I think the idea is to prioritise time communal areas as the main hubs with rooms for just sleeping. Eating in the room involved balancing plates on our knees while squeezed on the little sofa.

Before booking I went back and forth between the Ritz-Carlton Central Park and this property and in hindsight am beyond happy and ecstatic that we chose the Nomad location.  Considering I cannot think of any negatives to report on, I'll focus on the areas that impressed us most:The location: We spent much of our days in the Midtown vicinity seeing shows, the Christmas prerequisites such as the Rockefeller tree and the storefronts along Madison and it was truly a relief knowing that we would be making our way back to the hotel and the Nomad neighborhood without the throngs of crowds and chaos.  Of course it is NYC after all and even Nomad has an electricity to it, but the neighborhood simply felt (at least to us) much calmer and more relaxed with wonderful restaurant options within walking distance (including a very festive rooftop Christmas bar at 230 Fifth Rooftop Bar). The rooms: We had a Manhattan Club Level Room with amazing views of the downtown skyline.  We slept each night with the curtains and sheers wide open so that the view is what we woke up to.  I am a bit of a bathroom snob when it comes to hotels and this one exceeded any expectations with a very large soaking tub, separate shower (with great water pressure and hot water on demand) as well as dual sinks for my husband and I.  It has plenty of space and has a spa ambiance.The Club Lounge: By far and away, above and beyond the location and the amazing room, the Club Lounge is what impressed us most and would be reason enough for us to return to the Nomad location.  David and the entire Club staff team go above and beyond with their service, friendliness, and the sense of welcoming.  The food offerings each day FAR (FAR!) exceeded most other Ritz Club Lounges (the only location that I can put on par with this one may be Naples).  The food is creative and fresh and extremely well presented, amazing desserts and different cookies each day, an excellent breakfast spread, tea service in the afternoons, and the champagne flows freely and without having to ask for a refill.  Despite being in NYC where good restaurants and drinks are plentiful, we chose to end each evening with time in the Lounge with a cocktail while we soaked up the downtown view and it truly felt like a home away from home.We joked that the only recommendation that we can think of (this is a hint to management at both locations and one that fellow lounge guests agreed with us on) would be a reciprocal agreement between the Central Park and Nomad locations that would allow Club Lounge guests to visit both locations out of convenience.  Again, considering we spent so much time in Midtown and near the park it would have been fantastic to at least have an opportunity to pop into the Central Park location for a cocktail and compare.  Likewise, for guests at the Central Park location, having access to the Lounge in Nomad may be a great way to convince them to choose this new, fantastic location for their next New York City visit and for a change of pace and scenery.I cannot say enough good things about our stay and the property and we look forward to visiting again the next time we are in NYC."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

I had high hopes for this hotel, but after leaving the lobby, it went downhill fast. Reception was very nice and helpful. He promised the concierge would give some restaurant suggestions for my birthday which would be on day 3. Waited until the night of day 2 and called... concierge was out sick. Never got any suggestions. The hallway to the rooms was dark, had stained carpet, and the elevator needed a good wipe down.  We stayed in a king suite (2 adults in king and 2 kids on a pull-out sofa). My Mom stayed in another room and her bed felt like laying in a hammock (terrible). My husband requested champagne be in the room upon arrival- it wasn't there. Around 9:15 pm after a long day of travel, we had a knock on the door... the champagne arrived. Luckily my two kids were still awake. The room... where do I begin? We got a king suite. The sofa was so disgusting and dingy and looked like it was from the 80's. The mattress felt like you laid on springs and no cushion. The duvet was ratty and had rips in it. I felt so bad for my kids but they were good sports knowing it was my birthday weekend and I was already displeased with the room. They found a cigarette butt in the A/C vent. The king-room bed was somewhat comfortable but the pillows were awful. It felt like someone stuffed them with balls of socks. The carpet was stained, and the curtains in both rooms also had stains. The bathroom was so tiny and really a problem for 4 people. The sink stopper was broken and kept dropping down to stop the water from draining. It was covered in mildew along with the other drain. The shower grout also needed a deep clean. Housekeeping did a nice job sprucing up the room every day but unfortunately, the cleaning and quality of bedding was unbelievably below par. The continental breakfast was ridiculous. I've had better at a Hampton Inn. The advertised wine and cheese in the lobby sounded promising but when we arrived, it was a measly offering. One of the doormen was there for 2 days during our stay and was nice and opened the door for us, but the other one never opened the door or greeted us. In fact, my husband opened the door for someone to help them in during the rain and the doorman asked him to come inside and close the door-- completely oblivious to what just happened. Would I ever stay here again? Never. Why didn't I move hotels? We had my mother in another room, the city was busy, moving all of us would've been a task, and I didn't want to be charged for a room that I abandoned. We still had a wonderful time in the city and enjoyed the location of the hotel."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

I was early and the room wasnt yet available but my bags were accidentally brought up to another room which they thought was my room. Not a big deal since I had the show to see and my room was of course ready after the show.  The bed was turned down for us. What made it most memorable was the service.

I called Hilton to book our rooms as I needed connecting rooms and was told it was all set and given the price.  The night before travel I was notified for early check in on the Honors App and when I went to check in it showed three rooms and none of them were connecting.  I tried to call the hotel 4 times and never got an answer.  I then reached out to Hilton Honors and they could not reach the hotel either.  Finally reached the hotel through chat and they said they did not offer connecting rooms even though they saw that in my reservation.  After quite a bit of discussion they finally came back on the chat and said they had connecting rooms for us.  I also pre-booked for valet parking.  On the way to New York City I called to validate everything was correct and now they showed 4 rooms.  2 sets of connecting rooms.  It took a while to get the person to understand I only needed 2 connecting rooms but they finally understood and then made it sound like they did me a favor by cancelling the rooms that I never asked to be booked.  When we arrived found out we could not access valet parking and the hotel told my wife we needed to park the car ourselves in the valet garage and would have to carry our bags three blocks.  When we checked in they charged us significantly more than what was quoted when I made the reservation and told me that was the rate at the time of check-in so apparently reserving ahead of time is of no use.  The staff there was not friendly other than I would like to call out Veronica in housekeeping and the waiter in the restaurant who served us breakfast on the last day.   They provided exemplary customer service and the hotel could benefit having them train new team members on customer service.  The next day after check in I contacted Hilton Honors to discuss the overcharge and was hung up on three times.  Finally was told a manager from corporate would call me and that never happened.  A gentleman at the hotel talked to me and offered me points for the inconvenience and I responded that he could do what he wanted to but I would not stay at Hilton again after the service I saw supplied by the Honors program and the hotel both.  After returning home I contacted Hilton Honors again and relayed that I never received a call from management and was told that the file was showing that the hotel stated it was closed satisfactorily.  I told the agent that if that is what Hilton believes then it just reinforces what I see as their view of customer service.  It is to bad as the location of the hotel is great and it has an opportunity to be a premiere hotel and it would have been easy for Hilton Honors to keep my view of booking with them but the combination of the hotels approach, the way some of the staff responded, and the way that Hilton Honors responded I will move my business to another chain.  One other tip, if you are driving an EV to Manhattan I recommend you charge up in NJ before crossing over as there are few spots to charge in Manhattan. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The best thing about it is its location; as mentioned by many others, Penn Station is opposite and the subway from there goes all over the city.  The hotel claims to have undergone a programme of refurbishment. I was struggling to identify where. Our room (22nd floor) has not seen any refurbishment for some time and the bathroom was from a different era. It was also very small. The common parts too clearly need some attention.  The lobby of the hotel is small. It is always busy and there are few places to sit. There always seemed to be a queue of people waiting to check-in/check-out/speak to reception. The reception staff were not the most friendly nor helpful and the duty manager was downright rude: when I talked to her about those I described as her 'colleagues', she made it quite clear they were not colleagues but her 'staff'!   We had trouble on two of the three days we stayed with our keycard for our room. to get them re-programmed, one has to show appropriate ID at reception. But our ID was in the safe in our room: neither of us is in the habit of walking around with our passports. That really sent the hotel into a tizz and we had to be escorted to our room and were watched obtaining our ID and returning to reception. One can appreciate the need for caution and care but perhaps such is the impersonal nature of large hotels with a transient clientele.  The bed was comfortable enough. There was just about sufficient storage in the room. The cleanliness of the room was not as good as I would have expected but neither was it terrible.   There is a storage facility for luggage but, of course this being New York, there is a charge for it.   This was my first stay in New York and so I am not really in a position to compare it to other hotels in the city.

If you have ever stayed in NYC, you know how loud it can be. This location is near transportation (subway and sky-liner) into Manhattan and Queens but feels remote and quiet. The views from the East River to the east side skyline are outstanding. They offered us early check in and the staff was so gracious and welcoming. Our tween loved the cool factor of the hotel. We will be back asap. "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

This is a brand new crappy hotel. The rooms are admittedly small, but I didn't expect or could predict what would go on in that space. I booked the Murphy bedded room, thinking I could just fold it up and it'd be a larger room. The first room had hair in the sink. The second room seemed ok, but sitting on the toilet (people do) your knees hit the sliding frosted glass door. The shower is next door to the toilet and cut off from the toilet by the same frosted glass wall and door. However, two things happen when you turn on the shower. First, turning it on activates the shower wand, which shoots water across the room and onto the sink area - all of it. Second, having the sliding glass door across the toilet, the water floods the toilet room when coming out of the shower head and the floor of the room until you close the sliding glass door. Then, at 7 am on the dot, a smell of a bonfire wafts through the room for a couple hours. No idea where that's coming from. I hit the breakfast in the hotel but be careful....there's an automatic 21% gratuity added to your bill and then they ask for an additional tip. On top of that there's the destination fee (quite frankly, every hotel is a destination so why the fee...just add it into the rate as it's taxed the same as the room rate...but then this hotel wouldn't be competitive at all and just a sad small tiny roomed hotel that no one wants to stay) that's just an attempt to get more money out of you.

The hotel's distinct ambiance, characterized by moody, dimly lit hallways and rooms, imparted a particular atmosphere that, while captivating for some, might not entirely align with everyone's tastes. One noteworthy issue we faced was a light out over the closet, which created a visibility challenge. Though we reported it, the solution came in the form of lamps rather than a light bulb replacement.   The room's temperature controls presented their own quirk, seemingly adhering to a consistent temperature of around 69 degrees, regardless of our adjustments for heating or cooling. Nonetheless, the hotel's location close to the subway was undeniably convenient, although it's vital to mention that the nearby food pantry attracted a lot of displaced individuals, leading to their occasional presence around the building. Additionally, on the day we checked out, one of the elevators was unfortunately out of service, causing a bit of a bottleneck.  In terms of rating, the Maramara Park Ave Hotel seems to sit comfortably within the realm of a 3-star experience, not quite reaching the pinnacle of a full 5-star establishment.   Despite these nuances, the hotel's rooms were a breath of fresh air—spacious, comfortable, and perfect for unwinding. The darker ambiance might not suit everyone, but for those who appreciate a cozier setting and prioritize a conveniently located stay, it offers a unique charm.  One distinctive touch we encountered was the pervasive scent of bergamot throughout the hotel. While some might find it pleasant, I personally found it a touch overpowering, especially as it extended to the soaps and lotions provided.  Overall, the Maramara Park Ave Hotel offers an experience tailored to those who appreciate its specific atmosphere, convenient location, and unique scent. It's an excellent choice for those seeking something a bit different, but perhaps not the best fit for those desiring a more traditional or versatile accommodation experience. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

I travel to NYC for work a few times a year and this hotel was on par with most that I have stayed at. I was a little bummed that I didn't get a high room as I had called to request the day before. But I think that since they let me check in early, it totally made up for it. The weather was very blustery and it was downpouring - so I definitely didn't want to walk around for a few hours before check in. I didn't press the matter since I was soaked and cold. But, just an aside, not all rooms have the spectacular floor to ceiling windows with panoramic view as described. My 4th floor room had a sizable window that overlooked the back alley and fire escapes. It was, however, very quiet. I suppose I would choose comfort over aesthetics.The room was fairly comfortable. I did have to stop by a department store and pick up a $10 pillow, but I do that at many hotels. The bed was a little lumpy, but fine. The shower was fine, though it lacked a shelf to put your toiletries. They provide their own toiletry line. But if you have facewash or a razor, etc., there is nowhere to put it other than the floor inside the shower. The mini fridge was packed to the gills with mini bar fare, but I was able to squeeze in my own drinks to keep them cool.I didn't try the café or bar - there is food, coffee, convenience/department/grocery stores within a few blocks. The subway is really close too.The staff that I interacted with were pleasant and professional. The door man or concierge would greet me on every coming and going.

I decided to book this hotel for end of year because of its great location and raving Tripadvisor reviews. We travel to NYC often, so we know what to expect from hotels in the city. We were not impressed by the Library Hotel and won't be going back.  There are positives for the hotel though, the first one being the aforementioned location. If you visit New York during holidays, you want to be in Midtown, close to where it all happens, but not in the middle of it (although we have stayed close to Times Square in some occasions). The area around Bryant Park, which is lovely during holidays, is our favorite.  The hotel also has a beautiful library theme, which goes well with its location in Library Way, just a few steps from the NYC Library. Every room has a topic and books that go with it. Plus, there is a great common room with lots of books, coffee and refreshments 24/7.  This is by far the highlight of the hotel, which also has a reasonable rooftop bar (which I am sure is more charming in the summertime).  So far so good, so, what did we miss?  First off, we missed the quality of service we would expect for a hotel where we paid over $500 a night. The service was so non-existent that they didn't even help us in with our luggage when they saw we were struggling with our suitcases as we were coming back from a long international flight. They didn't help us on our way out either. Overall, it felt like the service was minimal and very impersonal.  Secondly, the rooms, and the hotel as a whole, are pretty dated. Everything, from the bathroom installations to the TV or the elevators are what you would expect from a decades old hotel that has not been renovated at all. But, it is not that charming-old that we have seen in other hotels in NY. It is just plain old. I get that the library theme goes well with \"old\", but this is a bit of a stretch.  Again, not a horrible experience, but you can definitely do better for that price range in the city by either going to a more modern hotel or a classic but charming one.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

Right down to having to ask everyday for the 2 bottled waters that were suppose to be included daily when the maid cleaned the room. Sometimes she would leave 1 - mostly none. Cleaning service was terrible. I don't think they mopped the floor the entire time I was there...2 weeks with 2 rooms. They just replaced towels, wiped things down and made the bed. I purposely put a vitamin on the bathroom floor to see if it would be cleaned up and it never was. Also the front desk staff is soooooo rude! One of the elevators was broken and I was waiting along with another group and mentioned I thought something was wrong because it was stuck on the same floor. The girl at the desk who was only a few feet away just stared at her computer- never looked up at us and mumbled \"They will be here at 4 to fix it.\" No apology - nothing. Not even a sign on the elevator so people would have the opportunity to squeeze in with another group in the one that was working instead of expecting the other to come along. I asked the front desk for an umbrella one day and the girl was like, \"you have one in your room\", and then she saw my husband had it, so she got us another and said,  \"make sure you bring that back!\" No body ever asked how our stay was going the entire 2 weeks we were there. Not a single friendly comment or welcoming gaze from anyone. Just staring at the computer at the front, barely acknowledged when you came in. There is literally no lobby at this hotel, just a front desk and you walk by staff members all the time. Plenty of opportunity to establish a rapport with the guest...nope! Our daughter recently moved into an apartment across the street from 48Lex. We were hoping this would be our place to stay when visiting her - definitely not!

If you have more than 2 guests, either pay for 2 rooms or find a different hotel. A thin layer of cotton over a jumble of creaking metal bars apparently counts as a “mattress”. I don’t typically have back pain, but after 3 nights on that mess of a layout, I am bent over in pain. Given that our NYC portion of the trip has been followed by ongoing travel, I am very disappointed about this, as it’s hindered my enjoyment of the rest of our trip. Also, the sofa bed is laid out poorly. The only way to get from one side of the room to the window, is to roll across the “bed” (aka piece of cotton covering the metal bars). The bed stretches all the way to the dressers, meaning there is no way to walk around the bed.Location was good, that is why we chose this location. Staff was very hit or miss. Some associates were outstanding and went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and to make us feel welcomed; others seemed bothered when we asked questions regarding the property. The phone didn’t work, so we had to go to the desk downstairs when we needed something. The bathroom door felt like you were closing a vault in order to get it to fully shut. I’m guessing the building has shifted over time, but this left us shoulder checking the door to get it shut. The air would randomly set to odd temperatures (72° to 75°, 68° to 72°, etc.) without us adjusting it.

The rooms are super clean , modern ,small but feel larger do to the floor to ceiling windows . Maid service was outstanding. We sleep in till 1PM every every day and they would clean our room around our schedule with a simple phone call to front desk.Fastest elevators I ever been on for a hotel. No need to go to front desk for check in when using the Hilton app on phone.-Just go straight to your room.  Very minor annoyance: These were very small issues: The Hilton app on phone stop working to unlock room door. Used the card hotel provided to unlock door.

I called the front desk and the concierge offered to go up to the 4th floor and check to see if I left it in my room (I did).  I never would've asked someone to do that and couldn't believe she volunteered. So kind & I enjoyed the rest of my evening because I didn't need my wallet.  The rooms are clean, nicely decorated, and the beds are very comfortable. There's not much \"wiggle room,\" especially in the bathroom, where the sink alcove is just slightly over shoulder-width.

At the time of visiting this hotel, I was a Titanium Elite member under the Marriott Bonvoy loyalty programme.  I booked a skyline view room with 2 double beds which averaged out to $700 per night.  (3 adults sharing).  I thought, being a Titanium member, I would receive a complimentary upgrade.  However, I read many reviews of New York hotels having little to no upgrades when it comes to suites.  So, I didn’t want to chance it and I used my SNA (Suite Night Award) upgrade perk under the elite benefits of the loyalty programme.    You can watch the full review on YouTube at Luxury Vegan Travel.  I chose to be upgrade to a Marvellous Suite which was successful!  The room was nice and had plenty of space, a separate lounge and bedroom, 1.5 bathrooms and 2 TVs!  Watch the video for the full details.  As an elite member, when checking in, I was given an option of a welcome amenity on top of complimentary breakfast!  The choice was 1,000 Marriott Bonvoy points or a $10 food & beverage credit.    The hotel charges a $25 destination fee, daily!  Many think this is because they are staying in Time Square.  However, the hotel, like most in New York, does not have a swimming pool, BUT, within the destination fee, the hotel can provide you with a voucher to use at a nearby gym (about 5-10 minutes walk) where they do have a swimming pool!  Pretty cool!  However, there is a decent gym onsite (more for cardio and a few weights machines and dumbbells).  The complimentary ‘elite’ breakfast is limited to a small menu (shown on the video) but they do also have an a la carte menu.  Sadly, the elite menu does not have any egg dishes for those of you who eat eggs.  These and other western breakfast options like bacon will need to be purchased from the a la carte menu.  They did have almond milk for those of you who don’t drink dairy milk.  Overall, as an elite member very close to reaching the top tier (Ambassador), I don’t think the breakfast is very good, especially compared with hotels almost in touching distance like the JW Marriott Marquis or JW Marriott Essex House.  If I plan to visit Time Square again, I would choose a different hotel, with more benefits for elite members.  However, if you are not an elite member or are gold or below, then this isn’t much of an issue and otherwise, the hotel is in a good location.  Check out the video on YouTube at Luxury Vegan Travel and I hope you enjoy it! …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

We arrived at the hotel at 3:10pm.

Some were waiting for over an hour for their rooms to be ready. The front desk personnel were rude to anyone who asked for an update on when the room would be ready. The reason that bothers me is if I’m an hour late to check out, I get charged another night but the hotel can withhold your room from you for over an hour and you still pay full price. My wife was feeling poorly as she is diabetic and her blood sugar needed to be checked so we asked Jose if he knew when our room would be ready. Jose was the most helpful person at the hotel. He called the manager over and explained our situation and the room was ready much quicker. The only reason I’ve given the hotel any stars at all is because of Jose. When we got into our room we discovered that we were paying $400 a night for a room the size of a shoe box that was not properly cleaned. (Cleaning was supposedly the reason we weren’t able to check in on time) there was hair in the shower, the room hasn’t been dusted, there was stuff on the sheets. Would I stay here again?

This review is for a 2 night stay in a Classic King room on an upper floor. We dined 2x in the salon for breakfast, had cocktails in the bar, went to high tea, browsed the boutique shop and utilized the fitness room. Let me start by saying I am not a hotel snob…I’ve stayed everywhere from Holiday Inn Express to The Four Seasons. I also worked in the hotel industry for 18 years. This review is based on this experience relative to the price and my industry experience.  Departments, in order of effectiveness and level of professional service (from best to worst)  1.\tHousekeeping/Engineering. The rooms and common areas were IMMACULATE. I cannot say enough about the level of cleanliness. Unparalleled turn-down service. It felt like I was the first person to ever stay in room 1103. Everything was fresh and spotless, not a speck of trash in the common areas. We literally saw someone scrubbing the lobby bar floor on her hands and knees.  Engineering - the sheer fact that you rarely saw engineering meant they were doing their job. We saw them one day painting baseboards in the hallway. (One light in the salon spotlighting a chandelier was out though.) 2.\tBell Staff/Doormen. Professional, friendly interactions, (esp Kelvin) who remembered our name and offered bottled water upon our departure to the airport. 3.\tFront Desk. The female who checked me in was very thorough and literally escorted me inside the elevator and showed me how to use the key pad. She explained the hours of operation for all facilities and fully detailed the amenities.  4.\tFood and Beverage. This was the most hit or miss department. Service ranged from acceptable to frustrating. The host stand was the most consistent and professional, esp the woman with a high ponytail and a mask (Mickie?). Drinks went dry numerous times both days, we had to go to another table to get Splenda (30 minutes after they opened, so clearly not restocked from the day before), straw wrappers and sugar packets laid in clear view in excess of 10 minutes before someone finally cleared them (This NEVER would have happened at other Fine establishments). We always had to ask for the check to be delivered. They mixed up our tea pots during tea service.  5.\tConcierge and Fitness Room Attendant. The Concierge is usually a primary player in high end hotels, but here he meekly sat at a desk in the lobby and did not interact AT ALL with lobby patrons. When there was a line waiting to check in, he didn’t stand up and interact with guests, thank them for waiting, introduce himself and offer his services. When we passed by en route to/from the boutique, he didn’t even look up or offer a simple greeting.  Fitness Room Attendant…there wasn’t one. It certainly doesn’t have to be a full time attendant, but no one even bothered to check the facility within the duration of a 90 minute workout.  Memorable Touches/Pros •\tStunning bar décor  •\tEach hallway was like a mini-museum with Baccarat pieces outside rooms •\tRooms were impeccably designed using mirrored surfaces to enlarge. Every detail reflected the Baccarat brand…from the faucet handles to the glassware in the mini bar. •\tIn-room beverage amenities, boxed chocolates, toiletry items •\tIn room stationary, debossed notepad, feather pen •\tRoom keys designed in the color and shape of the brand logo with a decorative silver key attached •\tFitness room hours were 7am-7pm but stated they would open outside those hours upon request •\tVisible security throughout property •\tLow profile hotel exterior and signage feels like you’re walking into a secret place  •\tAcross from MOMA  Missed Opportunities •\tBoutique should sell the book featured in the room, their signature scents, tea sachets as used in the afternoon tea •\tCoffee/tea service in horribly bland mugs and pots •\tNo matchbooks •\tNon-logoed sugar packets •\tOffering a dessert-only tea (without savory elements)   Food and Beverage •\tUnnecessarily extravagant pricing for the bar. Their signature Old Fashioned (with custom Makers Mark), although showy, was $54. •\tThe tea service was also overpriced at $140. They also offer a vegetarian tea (same price) off menu.  •\tFood presentation was always good, but the fledgling service detracted from the kitchen’s best efforts   Fitness Room •\tWhat a disappointment…the room itself should have some design on the windows (echo the print that was on the bedsheets, perhaps).  •\tMini fridge was filled with glass water bottles that were always lukewarm at best.  •\tNo chilled towels as advertised. We called the concierge to get some because no one checked on us. Someone came down after 10 minutes and said they didn’t have any chilled towels, but could run one under cold water for us????? …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

It's fine.I'm originally from NYC, and I now live in a big city right on a busy street and on the airline route, but the noise from the street in our room was LOUD.

We'd already settled in and unpacked by the time we realized this late at night, so we didn't feel like swapping out. I ended up putting in my earphones and listening to white noise, which helped somewhat. Oddly, the windows are not the noise reducing, double-pane type, which I would expect from this level of hotel.

We did.  We were given wrong information for both AM coffee and the restaurant opening times. One front desk person told us we could only order online at the restaurant, I finally went downstairs and found a sit down buffet in the back. We were in town for work and there is no microwave or coffee maker in the rooms. This caused stress, a very high Starbucks delivery bill and we were late to our conference.

A radio was also set playing jazz music softly as I entered the beautifully restored room with its comfortable old style high bed and eccentric décor. Even though the room overlooked the street it was quiet and I slept perfectly.  The shared bathroom on the hallway was no inconvenience and like a museum of Victorian plumbing and tiles with its clawfoot bath and vintage shower.  The place is close to the underground and bus stops only twenty minutes from downtown Manhattan, and I felt safe walking home at night.  Being able to leave my bags in the sitting room to collect later after I checked out was a real bonus as I had a late evening flight back to London.

The room we stayed in smelled like mildew, the mattresses seemed to be very, very old and worn out, and the bathroom smelled like a litter box. It had a moldy, plastic shower curtain.

The hotel is in a perfect location for such a visit. We reserved the “Deluxe Room with a View”. We arrived at the hotel about three hours ahead of the 3 p.m. check-in time, intending to leave our bags and go out for a few hours. However, Deniz at the front desk found a room that would soon be cleaned and told us to stand by. Chatting with her about current art exhibits, she learned that it was an anniversary trip and upgraded us to a room with a king bed and two corner city views. Still decidedly NYC size, but comfortable for us and the modern, simple decor was relaxing. The lobby and lobby lounge are quite spacious with many areas for conversation and relaxation. During our stay Deniz also had a bottle of wine and a chocolate sampler delivered. We felt like we had a friend in the lobby. That first day we discovered the Morgan Library, just over a block from the hotel. The Library is a lesser-known attraction that is well worth a couple of hours for those interested in books, history, and architecture, with the bonus of an excellent café for lunch. When we arrived back at the hotel after dinner the lounge had a good jazz band playing to top off our day. The next morning, we had the hotel buffet breakfast which featured a wide array of American and European choices, at a reduced price for hotel guests, to get us out for a long day of MOMA and Broadway. On our final morning, we picked up a good breakfast from Rico Bagel across the street, checked out, and stored our bags while we went to the Met. The staff are uniformly friendly, pleasant, and helpful and we highly recommend this hotel.  …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

I went to NYC on a girls trip to see the ciy at Christmas Dec 3-6th. I was truly disappointed with Le Meridien New York Central Park. Upon arriving, there was no bell man to help with luggage. There was one line to check in with 5-6 people in line with nobody else to help with the process. Several things in our room didn't work or were broken including a window that wouldn't close all the way, the fan in the bathroom, as well as some cabinets that were falling. The other 2 guests and myself were slpitting the room charges. We each gave out credit card and were given a receipt with the charges to each of our cards. When I check my credit card app today, I had an additional $5935.07 charge to the hotel tht I did not authorize. My friend had an additional $1089 that she did not authorize. I called the hot4el and was sent to billing. I got a vm that said to leave a message with the information. Then the voice mailbox was full so therefore I could not leave a message. On the vm, it said if you ahd immediate concerns to email receipts@lemeridiennyc.com. So I  did that and explained my concerns. About 20 minutes later, I got an undeliverable email response stating that the email only accepts messages from senders inside the group or from a contact list and that my email wasn't on the contact list. I was so mad and upset, I called my credit card company to dispute the charge and they contacted the hotel and told me that the hot3el has 3-5 days to respond. I will NEVER stay at this hotel ever again and will be contacting the BBB and posting other reviews as well to other sites so customers are aware of their practices.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

When we checked in and during our stay, we didn't find the staff at the Reception particularly friendly nor helpful. We booked a deluxe quadruple room in March for Dec / Jan, but found the room really small and expensive. There were other alternatives but we thought a quadruple room in a relatively new hotel close to Times Square will be a good idea. The hotel and rooms were decorated like a beach resort. Our room cannot see Times Square but had good view of The Edge. As the hotel was pretty new, the beds were really comfortable. We each got our own luggage and only one suitcase can be opened at a time. There was no separate toiletry except the 3 bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soap attached to the wall of shower. The water pressure was weak, and it will stop for a few seconds in the middle of shower. There were 3 elevators but often there's a queue waiting to get up and it would take quite some time to get down in the morning. The speed of the Internet was average. The clock in the room was 15 mins early, and I can't find a way to set the time correctly, so I just unplugged it.

We were assured this was simply for feedback, not a sales pitch. Lured by the promise of a $100 incentive, we agreed to attend.Contrary to what was promised, we were subjected to an aggressive sales pitch. Worse yet, without our explicit consent, they ran a hard credit check on my wife!

The lack of transparency and respect for customer consent is not only unethical but also deeply concerning for any potential guest.As a result, I strongly advise against staying at this property or engaging with the Wyndham brand.

Stayed for two nights for business on the top floor, small but convenient room, well equipped with a coffee machine, comfortable bedding, looking over the back yard so perfectly quiet (an asset as 32nd street can be quite noisy). My only issue was a shower that took some time to warm up. In dire NY winters, the individual radiator is definitely an asset. I liked the fantastic Art Nouveau facade of the hotel and its history : the Hotel Aberdeen was popular in the Roaring Twenties and was one of the first places to accept individual bookings by woman. The place comes along with its own mystery story, the death of a Mary Jeannette Caley in suite 72 (when there were suites) back in 1905. I didn't have the opportunity to meet her ghost... Great location, very friendly and helpful staff - a bit pricey, but this is NY and hotel rooms are hard to secure! My advice would be to spruce up the lobby and some of the facilities to recall the old Hotel Aberdeen (maybe retrieve the name that can still be read on the side of the building). More could be made of this place as it boasts a landmarked facade, quite a history and, yes, a great location. Much of Manhattan is within walking distance, some great restaurants (in particular the Press Club Grill), ten minutes from Penn Station. A place I'd recommend and gladly return to."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

It was expensive and towards the top of the budget so my expectations were high. But delighted to say I loved my time there and felt really at home. They were kind enough to offer us an upgrade to the Pied a Terre apartments, which really helped us have a great and relaxing stay.  I really have no criticism of the apartments the beds were super comfortable and the apartment spacious and homely, but sone with style and taste. There where a few minor wrinkles that I only mention as to offer scope for making things even better: 1) There are some paint splatters on the grey/white marble tiles, it just needs someone with a good eye to scrap them of. 2) Some of the bathroom fittings are a little poorly done (loose or away from the wall), and again a component maintenance man could fix these. 3) Brass is a nightmare as it needs polishing, in general I didn't might the patina but around the toilets and in the bathrooms it looked a little unclean. 4) The sealant around the bath in 3E is beyond amateurish, it just needs redoing. 5) The hallways could benefit from some coat storage to prevent clutter in the apartment, especially if the weather is poor you've nowhere to put wet things. 6) The lighting in the closets is a great idea, but the top shelf stops the light illuminating the clothes making it a little useless. None of this impinged on our stay and the uniqueness and history more than made up for those tiny details.  Not sure how I can justify and return visit but I'm working on it.

It was bright, spacious, mostly well-outfitted for longer stays (we were there just shy of 3 weeks), and the staff were uniformly friendly and helpful.  The supplies like soap, towels, kitchen supplies and utensils, were well-thought out and useful.  It was very clean when we arrived and was easy to keep clean. It was surprisingly quiet, given its location on a major tunnel entrance/exit, and the view of very large buildings that was due to that presence on the major arterial (thus space to see the buildings rather than just walls) gave us endless entertainment. Those visible buildings were mostly if not entirely offices, so they were quiet in the evenings and weekends. The picture on this site showing the interior shows those buildings across the recessed arterial.  Things that were a little annoying and didn't really affect our affection for the place:  1) The bed was fairly wavy/not flat, and although it didn't give us backaches or anything, it was challenging to find comfortable sleeping positions.   2) The couch (similar to the one in the picture here) was great to lie down on, not so much to sit in without adding many pillows. Since there were more pillows than we needed on the bed, this worked out fine. Not sure if it was pull-out bed, the top cushion was nice as it was.   3) The bathtub drained slowly, so you were almost always standing in a pool. I could hear the neighboring units having the same problem, and it did always drain. That was not an issue but it was odd.  4) Seemingly because it's a building with glass front (looks like a former office building that was converted, which it was), there were no exhaust fans anywhere. The only way to get smells out was to open the glorious windows, which we did for brief times in January and which fixed the smell problem, and steam from the shower seemed to dissipate in the dry January air. Still, no exhaust fans was odd.  Again, none of those things would cause us not to stay there, except maybe if the bed was worse than it was. But it wasn't, and we would love to stay there again for even longer, and hope we can.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

Everyone we met at the hotel was very nice and helpful. The hotel restaurant has a view that looks out over bustling Times Square and straight at the Time Square Ball. The hotel is pleasant. Parking is tricky and I recommend calling the hotel about ten minutes before you arrive for instructions. It will be noisy from outside activities like sirens because of the city life but I expect that must be true of most hotels in NYC. I had a problem during the night because someone in a neighboring room turned their TV on at 2:30AM for at least an hour. I had ear plugs and a white noise device playing but it was still loud enough to wake myself and my sons. I do not know if the noise reduction was just a problem in our room or typical of the rest of the hotel but I likely wouldn't return because of this issue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

One, there was an awful odor in the air. Two, there were no stores nearby or restaurants to eat at, buy or shop for anything. Three, you will feel cramped in the room unless you are by yourself. Four, breakfast is anything but that. They are still serving breakfast in brown bags which only offer a lot of sugary items, even the bagel isn't really a real one and nothing is served hot except for the tea or coffee that you can get from the dispenser in the lobby. I would recommend running to another hotel nearby for hot food if you are stuck like we were.  As the rest of the story goes, we had originally booked to stay in the Queen Double Room, and we had to switch to a Standard Double Room due to the strong smell (awful odor) from outside coming into the room. The photos on Booking.com do not show that you are near a sanitation depot/ landfill which doesn't help especially if you have allergies or other health issues. We had no choice after being exhausted and already paying for our 4-day stay and were told there were no other Queen Double rooms available. So, we took the Standard Double and were not compensated for the difference.  Then during the last 2 days of our stay there was no hot water, and we could not take a shower from Saturday into Sunday and were not able to have proper hygiene and be comfortable for our flight. This is all added to the stress after attending a funeral for a family member. We asked the front desk about this and if there was anything they could do. They told us to reach out to the manager via email later about it as he was not available on the weekend. We did, and even spoke to him about it. But we never heard back as he said he would reach out to us and try to make up for the inconvenience. Very disappointed and it shows a lack of caring for their customers' experience at their hotel and the hotel could have offered to do more in terms of service and customer satisfaction. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

One of the lamps didn’t even turn on. There was a visible tear in the duvet cover. We had requested a room not near the elevator when we made our reservation via the hotel’s own website but our room was (you guessed it) right by the elevator. Oh! I almost forgot: you cannot adjust the temperature in your room—we had a window a/c unit that barely worked and a wall thermostat that didn’t respond to our attempts to modify the temperature. Plus, the windows paired with the window a/c unit let any traffic sound right into your room. The entire experience was so very disappointing, but since we were only staying for one night, we decided to just go through with our visit. In the end, we paid about $526 for the room rate plus taxes and fees for a room that felt like something at a sleazy motel. Honestly, we burst out laughing after we checked out and got outside.

Personal items, including computers and toothbrushes, were recklessly displaced—abandoned on the floor and in the shower, devoid of care.Our plea for shower caps—a simple request—dragged on for an hour, further straining our patience and cramping our evening plans.

Our room was very clean.   It is not their fault that the owner of this hotel does not value supporting them with a building that is not run down and in need of maintenance and basic updating.  In fact, the only reason I give this hotel 2 stars is BECAUSE of the staff.  They are holding it together.  They deserve a serious bonus for having to deal with the shortcomings of this place.Location is great, but for the price I was surprised to find:1). TV/Cable boxes that do not work.  And it's not just our TV.  It is many room's TVs in the hotel.  They just don't connect.  It was almost comical....2). Furniture that looked like it was picked up at a garage sale and painted cream.  Which by the way is the same cream color as the walls, trim, and everything else.  A lazy way to freshen up I'm thinking....3). An unsecured front door. There is no keyed entry.  Anyone can walk in and go to any room and the elevator.  Yes, the staff is there....but that's it.4). Rooms have no carpet.  Which honestly was a good thing because then you know there is less of a chance of bugs, but the floor was some sort of composite that was cold.  it made the room cold and not fun to be in.5) Bathroom was clean, but there is mold in the grout. It's not from lack of trying with the cleaning staff.  The room was very clean.  It's the kind of mold that has permanently stained the grout and needs to be redone.   The tile and fixtures look very new, so it was odd that the tub doors were outdated and with mold.  Plus, whoever installed the tile and marble left gaps and poorly cut out areas everywhere.  There was a huge hole around the shower head.6) Some of the linens were old.  We had many cigarette holes in the pillow shams and blankets. Some of our towels were old and thin with a few threadbare holes.I'm not a fussy person and I don't need fancy accommodations.  I have stayed in MANY older hotels in the Central Park South/Midtown area without these issues.  I was not expecting a modern hotel.  This was just a sad case of a building not being kept current and comfortable.  There was nothing charming about this place.The restaurant that was attached - Joe Gs Italian - was very good.  Excellent pizza and salad.  Very nice dining room.  Too bad the attached hotel is not to that standard.There are better places to stay for the same $$.

The Ludlow graciously set up the pack-n-play for us prior to our check-in so everything was ready to go when we got there and they even included a blanket, Ludlow stuffed animal. organic soaps and lotions, and toddler robe — it was so precious. Not only did they provide those sweet arrangements for us, they also went out of their way on a busy Friday to set up a mobile hotspot for us so that we could set-up our travel Nanit which required a special Wifi outside of the hotel network. We were wowed by the whole experience and so grateful for their hospitality. Looking forward to coming back!  P.S. for any parent reading this review wondering about the Loft set-up it is a nice sitting area when you walk in, then a little hallway with the bathroom and continue down the hallway to the bedroom where there is room for a pack-n-play and also a little sitting area…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

It is NOT, in reality, as the fabulous photographs would indicate and we were particularly disappointed that the restaurant wasn’t functioning and that the stunning room, depicted in the photographs, was used as an ‘occasional’ bar.Our King Size Deluxe Double room contained one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. The linen was immaculate and luxurious and the room was replenished with white fluffy towels everyday. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. What stopped this room from fulfilling its potential was the astonishing SMALL size of the room and the absence of any natural light. The ‘slit’ window promised a ‘courtyard’ view, but looked out on to a litter strewn service corridor. Throughout our entire sixteen night stay we had to have artificial lighting on whenever we were in the room. The room was dark and oppressive and we felt claustrophobic throughout our stay. We desperately needed natural light…Customer Service is universally poor. The person who checked us in, and checked us out, seemed to regard the presence of any guest as an inconvenience. As our photograph depicts, a member of the staff team is taking an afternoon lap in the residents lounge!! The hotel is very well located and subway links are excellent. We could walk to most attractions and the immediate area is vibrant and cosmopolitan.The hotel lift wasn’t working for the latter half of our stay and, while this couldn’t be helped, was hugely inconvenient.All photographs for HGU New York are very misleading.

The rooms are very large, elevators work well, there is a nice pool/spa area at the top of the hotel, and the rooms are well appointed.  Staffing is somewhat limited, and lines can form at various areas. The lobby floor is crowded and just essentially a snaking hallway around to the elevator. Also, the upcharges for everything are incredibly annoying. Every attempt to get more money for a room upgrade just degrades from the fact that this is a very nice and fancy hotel. Also, our room wasn't spotlessly clean when we finally checked in. I can detail this, but small but obvious things made the room less than spotless. We were upcharged for a room upgrade, and then our room's availability was delayed until after it was supposed to be ready, and then the room was not spotlessly clean. They were very apologetic and generous to make up for this unfortunate mistake, and more than made up for the error with a room credit, waving the upgrade charge, and a free breakfast, which was excellent.  Now.. to the breakfast. If it's included in your rate, it's very good. The service is competent and friendly and professional. The food is well made and high quality. The prices are laughable. Expect to spend $60+ per person for breakfast that includes a modest breakfast entree and a single drink. I know, fancy hotel prices in NYC. But please, step outside. Go to any number of decent restaurants nearby and spend 1/4 the price. Look, the food and service are good. But the prices are just stupid. $14 for tea should be loose leaf in a fancy teapot, not a teabag. We all enjoyed the breakfast, but it is just stupid what it costs.  If you want huge rooms in a very nice hotel and can look past some of these problems to get a location that is perfect for exploring the park or going to a show, you will enjoy the Park Hyatt. I usually spend a little less, go in with lower expectations, and am more satisfied because of it.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

We are Marriott Bonvoy Gold Members and have stayed in over ten Ritz Carlton properties through the Amex find hotels program. Our experience at this particular property, however, was deeply disappointing and distressing.From the onset, we faced unwarranted suspicion and disrespect, particularly from a security guard named Edward Hanes. He followed us from the entrance to our rooms, scrutinizing us as if we were not legitimate guests, despite our confirmed bookings. His unprofessional conduct continued in the lobby, where he made us feel unwelcome and repeatedly questioned our guest status.The mistreatment extended to my three adult children, who were confronted by the same security guard and rudely told to leave the lobby, a public space, with no justification. This confrontation occurred under the watch of other hotel employees, who did not intervene.The following day, another hotel employee instructed us to leave the lobby unless we were purchasing something from the restaurant. This directive was inconsistent and seemingly discriminatory, as other guests were allowed to remain without question.Moreover, my wife was approached and told to turn off her phone under the mistaken belief she was taking pictures, even though she was simply making a phone call. This incident further highlights the targeted and disrespectful treatment we received during our stay.In addition to these negative interactions, we discovered unsanitary conditions under the mattress in our room, which appeared to be urine stains. We reported this to the hotel, but it was just another in a series of disappointments.We chose the Ritz Carlton for its reputation for luxury and exemplary service, expecting a special experience in line with the premium price of $2000 per night per room. Unfortunately, our experience was far from luxurious or respectful. Instead, we were made to feel like second-class guests, unwelcome and disrespected.This stay at the Ritz Carlton NoMad was not only a letdown but also an upsetting experience, leading us to reconsider our loyalty to the brand. We hope this feedback prompts the hotel to reevaluate its customer service and treatment of guests to ensure no one else experiences what we did."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

I have been loyal to Hilton as I travel three weeks a month for work (and even own a timeshare in mid-town Manhattan) and yet to check in early at noon instead of 3 pm was a $150 dollar upcharge for guests or $75 for Diamond members. I said no. Normally, a hotel will welcome guests in if there's a room available - it's called hospitality and reduces the number of check-ins later. The morning front desk needs to learn this. It literally costs nothing to check someone in early yet garners good will. If there are no rooms available because they're still being cleaned cool. That was not the case here. So...don't do it. The afternoon desk agents could not have been nicer. They get what hospitality is about. They were kind, considerate, welcoming. This is a rebuild of the old doubletree that sat at this spot for years. This a a beautiful redo. Rooms are on the small side, but not as small as the Motto brand which are half this size. Great amenities, comfortable beds. The bar was lovely and bartenders great. The bell staff at the front door were so nice. The rooms are wonderful, but you get what you reserve, so choose wisely. Rain shower, a bluetooth speaker in the mirror in the bathroom with clock and nightlight sensor were my highlights. But, it's in Times Square so bright day and night. There are black out curtains on the main switch at the front door of your room which can also control all the lights. Will stay again. But will check in after 4 pm every single time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

Who's excuse is it happens all the time ma'am. What you think my manager is going to tell you? So today I come into the Holiday Inn Express and there are about 40 to 50 suit cases and bags flooding both reception desks.  The workers are so consumed with bags they are ignoring clients. So now after waiting  for a room the young inexperienced worker now is left to mind the desk. I ask politely if there are any rooms available and one finally comes open I enter credit card  my credit card is charged 75 bucks for a hold . Ps my room is paid in full . Now I'm asked ro sign I sign my name and the inexperienced worker states the system is malfunctioning and to charge again .  I check my phone it say charge is completed. I then state hey it went through now she says oh no you have to do it again . I am like but it went through. I enter my credit card  It goes through a 2nd time , now I'm like I have 2 charges for same room. I called credit card company and they tell me two charges are made . I now go back to front desk ask to speak to manager that can over ride the charge  but inexperienced worker starts getting upset and raising voice a speaking with a very nasty tone. Saying this happens all the time and I have to wait until they decide to clear the charge.I said ma'am I understand your frustrated about my request  but you now have 150 of my money tied up and now you are up set. I asked the she get a manager on phone she refuses to call manager , general manager, corporate or a district manager. She said im not calling anyone you doint. Not nowing I am a manager and I know there's protocol but I'm sitting in lobby now waiting on a manager who she claims is out of town , then says  but a supervisor is coming at 3 pm which contradictory to her previous statements.   I am confused is a supervisor a manager or are supervisors not management. So I told her her tone is inappropriate she says my tone is inappropriate I'm like ma'am I have not raised my voice and you have my money not once but twice . But at this point I'm Hilton all the way after this mess. I am calling corporate next now. Please  Don't come here  they are very unprofessional and they are a hot mess at this point. The front desk clerk looks like shes under 21  and very unprofessional. As i waited for a room a person came to mop the floor with a half wet  mop and mopped around the 50 bags in the lobby .

If you are expecting luxury this is not the hotel for you. This is an old style building but apartments are large with 2 bed (1 king and 2 single with sofa bed in living room) and 1 bathroom, very basic furniture etc. Small reception area on way in and lady on reception  very friendly. Uber from Newark to Hotel cost c$130 incl tolls and tip  They are clean and the location fantastic on 49th st and Lexington - straight walk down to Rockafella centre and about 10 mins from Grand Central station. Breakfast provided is basic but super for families.  Food includes cereal, fruits , variety of pastries , yogurts and usually pre-made omelette or scrambled egg and some type of sausage.  Breakfast area tiny but you do have option to bring back to room. We were usually down around 7.30am and it was packed at that time .  We had to split up with 2 at one table and 3at another which was fine.  The biggest downside for us was that as it is old, the air conditioning unit sits outside of window so our window never fully closed.   Our room faced out onto Main Street so basically you were sleeping with window semi open in NewYork and it was so noisy with sirens , cars beeping horns etc ALL night so we so hard to get asleep.  Also we could hear dripping all night- we think condensation from conditioning unit above us drip onto our unit (it’s metal) so drip drip all night as well.   The lack of sleep really was the only downside.     Our 3rd child slept on sofa bed and if you ask at reception they have memory foam mattress toppers subject to availability and this made sofa bed much more comfortable   If they could solve for the air conditioning / window situation this would have been better - after long day in New York sleep is vital!! maybe if booking ask for room at back as may be less noisy ?  …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

Also the morning coffee in the lobby was a really good brew - I normally would go out to one of the many specialty cafes for coffee, but was more than happy with the complimentary cup. The room was small, as are most NYC rooms at this price point. I did not have a problem with noise other than the to be expected occasional street noise which was barely discernible. Music from the lobby area traveled up the elevator shaft but could not be heard inside the room. While I could hear the sound of other room doors opening and closing, I find that to be fairly common in hotels and was not bothered by it, nor was my dog. The room temperature was easily adjustable. I did initially feel a draft and some cool air but soon realized the window had been left partially open.

Gross carpet & cracked stone in the room, ancient radiator, ancient outlets. No detail in the room appears to have been updated since about 1985.   For one night it was a fine stay — and beds were great! But it was just very odd and felt kinda creepy.

The doors are heavy and alleviated hallway noise. The housekeeping was excellent and turn down service thoughtful with children’s slippers and macaroons complimentary every night.   The only thing I would say is the lotion and soaps are heavy with perfume so bring your own if sensitive. The bar soap was the only product we used. The lobby is a little cold in winter but on 4th floor you have comfortable cozy restaurant. They could fix this possibly this with entry heaters or supplemental in their garden lounge. The shared public restrooms are all male/female which left a lot of pee on the seats. I think better attention could be spent in this area or designation for sexes would be helpful or plan on using your room if you have small children as I do.   The food is excellent farm to table options without organic listed. The restaurant staff including wait staff are very welcoming and polite. Reservations required for main dining Zou Zou.

Just a personal preference, I respond better to bright and airy environments.The hotel room - a studio with a city view, has a cute boutique feel. The kitchen has a fridge and microwave which is great for microwaving leftover NYC pizza. The location is ideal if you are in town to watch a Broadway show. Walk in one direction for Times Square and the other direction for Central Park. We chose this hotel because it was the best priced and located hotel from the Marriott Bonvoy chain in the Manhattan area. It also included free breakfast. The breakfast area gets rather busy, but everything in Manhattan gets rather busy. If I were to stay in the city again, I'm on the fence about whether or not I'd return here, just because I'd like to compare it to another Marriott Bonvoy hotel.

Surprisingly there was no houskeeping for the first 4 days untill I asked the frontdesk (also very friendly but not trained) and then housekeeping came in even with 'do not disturb' sign on the door. Laundry : this is a disaster - had to way 3 days after depositing my laundry, It came back in a plastic bag not ironed and the shirts were not dry cleaned as requested. Upon check out on day 10 there was still a pair of trousers missing. I didnt get them back yet. The hotel should stop doing business with this supplier.The bar/restaurant is great at night, the staff is wonderfull. Food is pricy for what it is.

I found myself nodding along with several unfavorable reviews that mirrored my own sentiments.  My visits to Park Hyatt New York were twofold - one in July and another during the festive Christmas period - and they were starkly disparate experiences, akin to heaven and hell. Regrettably, the most recent stay aligned more with the negative impressions voiced by other reviewers.  The hotel boasts a superb location, splendid rooms, and excellent amenities such as the gym and pool. The culinary offerings are commendable overall. However, the service and hospitality fell woefully short of expectations for a purportedly luxury establishment charging upwards of $1200 per day.  Contrary to the warm reception I've received at other Hyatt properties like Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Centric, or Hyatt Place, there was a noticeable lack of proactive engagement at Park Hyatt New York. Despite my globalist status, the hotel seemed indifferent.  Check-in was less than welcoming; the staff at the desk omitted pertinent details about the hotel, and while it felt unwelcoming, I cannot substantiate this claim. Nonetheless, the disparity from my previous visit, which exuded a more luxurious check-in experience, was evident.  The breakfast service mirrored the disappointing narrative echoed by other guests. Excessive waits for menus and coffee became the norm. Strangely, some patrons received immediate attention while we languished without explanation. Throughout the meal, no staff checked in on us, marking a below-par service experience, a far cry from what's expected at a luxury hotel. Furthermore, the lobster scrambled eggs lacked the promised richness of lobster, a stark deviation from prior experiences.  It's disheartening to voice grievances about a hotel that touts itself as luxurious. The service offered falls short of the hotel's prestigious name. Regrettably, I won't return to test if service standards improve. Instead, I'll seek out a different luxury hotel for future stays.  To offer fairness, I must commend the service and the restaurant manager from my earlier visit in July 2023. It's unfortunate that their excellence wasn't replicated during this recent stay. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2"}]}

Access to Equinox gym as part of the package is also amazing - located right across the street. The Phillips Club is situated centrally and in a  safe and well connected neighbourhood: right next to the Lincoln centre, so close to the theatre district and restaurants and well connected via subway too - I easily commuted to Brooklyn during one of my stays.

Why would we book a city view room, which costs more, and then take a room without the view we specifically paid for? The 15th floor already has a partially obstructed view from scaffolding in front of one of the windows (picture attached), and the other window's blinds remain permanently closed because the cord was ripped completely off. As it was 20 degrees outside on a March night, and we checked in around 10pm, we had no other choice but to stay with the hotel room we got. We were offered free breakfast, but we booked this hotel for the view, not breakfast, and we declined. When we checked out the next morning, I made sure to make the front desk staff aware- and they seemed surprised that our experience was so poor. When I called the following day I was told by the supervisor that management is well aware that the blinds in many rooms are broken because the Bentley Hotel was used as a shelter during covid and the damages sustained to the hotel during that time have never been fixed or updated.

My feedback takes into account that the room cost $7500 for a four night stay in a corner Suite in December.   The TV was a non-smart LG TV from ~2014. I travel a lot for work and this was the first non-smart TV I have seen in a hotel in a couple of years. Speaking of 2014, why does a room at this price point include multiple DVD players? Are guests supposed to be going to their local Blockbusters to rent some DVDs? It just immediately makes the room setup look like dated and cheap Motel.   The room controls (blinds/lights) were all made by the same company, but some controls were analogue while others were digital. They didn't all work consistently. I can only assume that some controls (perhaps broken ones?) had been updated to the more modern (albeit, still at least 5-10 years old) digital controls, with some older analogue controls not getting the same upgrade. The mix of old and new controls might explain the inconsistencies we had with raising and closing the blinds.   The room we stayed in had several lights switches mounted crooked. It may sound like I'm being overly picky, and I maybe I am, but I don't mean they were off by a couple of degrees - the main living room light switch in our room was at a ~15 degree slant. Immediately noticeable to the naked eye. It wasn't even loose/damaged - it had genuinely just being mounted at that angle. Obviously it has no direct impact on your stay as a guest, but knowing a senior hotel employee signed off on that level of poor workmanship makes you question the overall quality of the Lotte.   The air-conditioning duct in the kitchen had been covered with a large white plastic board and white duct tape. I don't know why, and no one informed us about it before we checked in. The air-conditioning in general was very loud; I'm not sure if this was related to the taped over vent or not.   There was a very large bundle of wires, all taped together with green electrical tape, next to the bedside table. It looked like a safety hazard.  The kitchen sink was blocked on arrival. The bath plug was letting water drain at a quick rate when we arrived, so someone kindly came and tried to fix it. Unfortunately the problem continued the next day and we gave up. The seals on the plug looked absolutely ancient. The shower head was very old, full of limescale, and water was low pressure. One of our sinks had some sort of flow issue with the tap - the water would just trickle out. Again, none of these issues are immediate deal breakers, but at $1700 per night you really don't expect these sorts of issues, and if some do crop up you certainly don't expect this volume of problems.  The art choices were pleasant, and the sofa, tables and bed were all fine too.   However, the general lack of finishing at this price point was very apparent. Big scratches/dents just about everywhere (tables, counters, floor, walls). Smeared, grubby, shiny marks on the wallpaper. Grouting between the tiles has started to disintegrate between everywhere there are tiles. In the small bathroom one of the tiles had broken off, only to be physically placed back on the wall, not affixed with adhesive. Again, a broken tile that's hanging onto the wall isn't going to ruin your stay, but you can find much more generally pleasing hotels at this price point. It felt like the Lotte management have absolutely no pride in the Hotel.  It felt clean from a cleaners perspective, but the scratches and general years of wear and tear to the wallpaper/walls/floor/counters made the room feel dirty, or certainly very \"lived in\" which is basically the opposite of how a luxury hotel should feel. We all know hundreds of other guests have slept in the same room and bed as you when you're staying in a hotel, but we shouldn't be constantly reminded of based on how worn out the room is.  My assumption is that the Lotte Tower rooms are on the absolute brink of how far they can go without being redeveloped. They need new... everything. Either we were unlucky with our timing and perhaps all of the Towers will be redeveloped in the next year or so, or perhaps we were unlucky with our room selection and we were simply given a particularly shoddy room? Either way, I'm immensely disappointed with the hotel. Being as frank as possible, I feel embarrassed and conned. By the time I noticed any of the issues we had already unpacked and my wife and daughter had already fallen asleep (jetlag). The more I walked around the room the more it became apparent that these problems were presumably endemic to the state of the Towers in general, and complaining would achieve nothing.   I also didn't want to highlight all of the misgivings to my wife and put a downer on the trip, so I decided to not mention it to the front desk. In hindsight I wish I had done. I genuinely feel ashamed that I paid $7500 for four nights in a hotel with this level of poor finishing, outdated tech, and overall worn condition.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

And it was quite expensive.   I stayed here three nights.  Before coming, I picked my room as the Hampton Inn allows.  I chose Room 204.  However, they gave me a room several floors higher.  They told me that is not an actual guest room but a storage room.  He also said this is always a problem since guests select this room.  It seems like Room 204 should not be a choice then.  Had this not been a choice I could have chosen another second floor room. I usually choose a low floor due to some hotels having slow elevator service.  And the elevator service was terrible.  Also, the lights for many floors would not light up in the elevators.  The two elevators were slow and there is no space for guests to wait by the elevators.  The lobby and area by the elevators is quite tight.   I usually took the stairs but a staff member had to unlock the door to take the stairs up so that was not so easy.   The room was rather small, worn and dated.  There were used bars of soap in the shower.  The water from the faucet was warm so I brushed my teeth with warm water.  It was difficult to get warm water in the shower.  Perhaps I should have brushed my teeth in the shower where I got cold water.  The staff was polite and helpful.  Housekeeping stopped by when I was in the room two days though I did not need nor request anything.  The housekeeping staff I interacted with was good.  The breakfast was very good though that area is not spacious but it did not get crowded so I was happy with breakfast.  The lady running that area did a great job.  The location is great in some ways (close to Penn Station, Times Square, subway, etc.) and not so good in other ways (homeless people sleeping on the block and not clean).

In the middle of the night, the guy in the next “room” (who, strangely, always left his door wide open) was making a lot of noise. At one point he was shaving with an electric razor, which was quite noticeable at 2am. I opened my door and popped my head into his room to politely tell him that we could hear him.  He freaked out and jumped up and started screaming at me that he was going to bash my effing head in if I didn’t get back in my room (I had only been in the hallway for about 5 seconds) Then he physically attacked me and shoved me into my room and slammed my door. I’m sure he woke up the entire floor. The next day upon checkout, I told the front desk guy. He seemed completely indifferent and muttered something like “Huh...ok...I’ll talk to him about that”.

In addition to the above, we experienced serious issues with the hotel' staff and management:- One staff member got angry because our kids took a chair from another table, as the hotel staff did the two previous days (we needed a table for 8 people  as we were staying with friends). She asked my son to \"give back the chair\" as he was having his breakfast. The staff showed an extremely unpleasant and arrogant attitude towards my wife just because she is not fluent in English.    - The concierge and doorman tried to fool us when we asked them to call a taxi! They did all they could for us to take a private limo/van by lying to us on the taxi flat fee. We had to insist to have a taxi booked. Finally, when waiting for our taxi which was 1 min away (according to the app) the doorman insisted for us to take another one than the one booked though the app. I learned afterwards that some doormen are “commissioned” for such practices… Shameful. I am not sure those practices are legal but Marriott seems to be ok with that.-   During our 4 nights stay, our room could only be cleaned once since the cleaning lady only showed up at 5:30pm on December 30th and at 6:15pm on January 1st.

We made reservations months ahead of time for a \"Park View\" room (I will not dwell on the cost as I already said this was a splurge). I also emailed the reservations manager  that we were celebrating an anniversary. We arrived early (about 11 am) and were fully expecting to check our bags and walk around until the room was ready later in the afternoon. To our surprise, we were immediately personally escorted to a beautifully appointed, classic New York hotel room on the 39th floor overlooking the park. I can't say enough about the \"charm factor\" of this hotel, from the friendly uniformed elevator operators, the stunning Rotunda Dining Room, the robes, slippers, turn down service, etc., etc. This place reeks of \"old style glamour\". Sure, it’s an expensive fantasy, but if you are going to pay this much, you better get it, and here you do! To top it off, when we returned from seeing a Broadway show that evening, we found an anniversary cake, card, and a chilled bottle of prosecco waiting for us in the room.

While it isn’t cheap, the location can’t be beat because it is such a short walk to the hospital, and it is very comfortable. When my spouse was discharged, the hospital staff brought us through a tunnel under the street and then up the elevator right to the door of our room.  That was just fantastic! The room has a full kitchen, which is extremely helpful.   There are some idiosyncrasies though; our room had four sets of small and large plates, bowls and mugs and forks, but only three drinking glasses, butter knives, tablespoons, and teaspoons.  There was a large and small pot, a small frying pan, a tea kettle, a set of bowls with lids, a plastic pitcher, a medium and large sharp knife, and a cutting board in the kitchen.  The kitchen has a dishwasher and they supply dishwasher powder as well as dish soap and a small sponge.   Things you may want but they do not supply include paper towels, measuring cups or spoons, colander, and salt and pepper.   They also do not supply plastic cups, so I was really glad to have my plastic Wildo Fold-a-Cup for the bathroom as there is no great place to put something breakable.  There is not a lot of room for personal items in the bathroom so we found our hanging toiletry bags to be very useful.  A hairdryer is supplied in the bathroom. There is a combination safe in the room to secure valuables and you set your own code each time it is locked.  It is big enough to hold a tablet or small laptop.  The building seems has central heating and our room stayed at 75 degrees plus in late October/early November despite not turning on the room heater unit.  There is a large laundry room on a basement floor, but they do not have any laundry detergent vending machines so bring your own or plan on purchasing at a local store. Amazon sells laundry detergent sheets that are super easy to pack for travel.  The washers and dryers are card-operated not coin-operated. You can buy a card for $5 from a machine in the laundry room and add value there, or if you plan ahead, you can call Hercules (the laundry vendor) they will send you one in mail at no charge.  You can only add value to the cards in fixed increments either at the card machine in the laundry room or online and the increments are a little different so you may want to be aware of that.  The regular size washers and dryers are $3 a load, and large washers are $3.75 and the large dryers are $3.25.  There are only a few of the larger machines and they seem to be more popular than the regular sized machines.  The small grocery stores nearby are quite expensive, but there is a Target with more reasonable prices and a decent grocery selection 0.4-miles away, and you can get a delivery from them for a $10 charge by Shipt through the Target app which is well worth it.  We set up our delivery time for right after we arrived and it was fantastic to have the groceries delivered to the door of our room.  A large Trader Joe’s is located roughly 0.7-miles away.  It is really helpful to have a backpack for carrying groceries if you are going to walk to the grocery store."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

The staff at the desk provided terrible customer and were rude.  The first night we were put in a room that was not safe where I slip in the shower as the floor was poorly cleaned and maintained.  Mario, one of the staff members at the desk was rude and aggressive towards me and my wife when we brought up the issue on not have accessing to our PAID room as the card access was not working. When my wife was talking to Mario and he turned his back on her and went away. His actions was beyond disguising and he got very confrontation with me. My son got very scared and still to this day brings up that situation. He is 5 years old and no kid should feel uncomfortable like that and pay a high amount of money to stay at hotel to receive. The last night of our stay, I went to the rooftop restaurant and I ordered a beverage at the bar and the manager came up to me call my last name only as if did something wrong. Told me that I have a bill to pay as the manager named Wilson told me that I had no credit card on my room. That was not true and I had a credit card on file and swiped it multiple times at the front desk during my stay. The way he spoke to me and his tone and he accused me of doing something wrong and unethical. Just the way he looked and talked me especially just saying my last name, i was being discriminated by him because of me being hispanic. I explained the situation to the supervisor Nicholas and he tried to downplayed it and saying that I was not discriminated. He diminished my feelings and promised me that I would followed up with the Manager Glenda to get full refund of my stay. That never happened and I was misled by Nicholas and his staff. Also, I never received a survey from hotel. I always received a hotel survey from the hotel after I checkout from a Marriott hotel through email and I never received a survey.

Fresh flowers, curated art work, hardwood floors, desk and armchair rendered a residential feel to the environment. Classic casement windows that opened, provided natural light, fresh air and cityscape views. A wood burning fireplace elevated the coziness of the space. A marbleized bath was outfitted with separate soaking tub and shower, dual basins and heated floor. The Lowell is endowed with an array of eating and drinking venues. The Majorelle is a restaurant offering a menu of French classics fused with Moroccan influences. The decor of the Majorelle is \"well dressed\" with beautiful floral arrangements and table settings. Luxurious dishes from the menu include: Snails in Puff Pastry, Grilled Branzino, Roast rack of Lamb, Duck Breast and Pistachio Souffle (the house specialty). I tried the Lobster Risotto....excellent.......and I didn't pass on dessert.....Mille Feuille.....a gem of a sweet. Seasonal bar bites and coveted cocktails can be had at Jacques Bar with a decor inspired by the beautiful Majorelle Garden of Marrakesh (I loved the Moroccan Mint Tea). The Club Room is an absolutely sumptuous communal place where one can enjoy a drink and/or a small bites menu. The Pembrooke Room is a renowned European emporium available for daily breakfast, brunch and afternoon tea.

I have stayed at both brands around the US and including other NYC locations of the Spring Hill Suites.  This hotel was built for packing in as many as possible.  It is bursting with mostly tourists and has very compact if not over run common areas.  Elevators can be very frustrating, full, stopping all the time and long waits.  The breakfast was so full that there were lines and in four days I didnt use the breakfast benefit.  The lobby is very small, mainly a desk and four elevators where people queue up.  While the price was reasonable, any one staying there should be prepared for crowds.  The first room I had was a double bed room, two beds. There was practically no room for anything else.  The bathroom was small and two feet from the beds.  There was no desk just a tiny little space with a tiny chair.  The bathrooms offer little privacy if your with others, many have remarked that the doors (sliding pocket doors) dont really section off the little bathroom, there are gaps that well, use your imagination on noise and even views by angles.  Just too many corners cut in my opinion on this design to maximize space.I did move to a one bed room (king I think) that was much more comfortable with a little seating area and work space.  I would definitely not call any room a 'suite' at this hotel based on the room types I stayed at.  Other spring hill suites locations and courtyards in NYC afford a much better proportioned room with better conventional bathrooms with privacy.  I did find the front desk people friendly.

We really liked the location, which was away from the craziness of the Theatre District, and was a convenient half a block away from the Lexington/63rd subway station. Central Park was also very easy to access.  The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a room up on the sixth floor with two queen beds and a sofa-style pullout for our fifth person. The room was quite spacious, and had a kitchenette - very handy for buying some snacks from the Morton Williams supermarket across the street from the subway access. The room was clean but could use a bit of freshening. The blackout blinds were fantastic for keeping our room dark, and our family kept on an MST schedule for our holiday. The limiting factor for a group our size was the bathroom, which was very small.  The hotel was nice and quiet for how busy it seemed to be. Overall a nice stay, The Gardens was a great base of operations for giving our kids a NYC experience.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

We started having issues with our booking before we even arrived when purely by chance I was looking at the hotel website days before our stay.  Firstly, it was only then that I saw that refurbishment work was taking place (I wasn't notified) and then I also saw that I had booked and paid for a bed and breakfast rate through Booking.Com and breakfast would not be available for 2 mornings of our stay.  I contacted the hotel and was advised that 2 mornings breakfasts would be taken off my bill.  The website photos did not prepare me for the poor state of the hotel.  Entry to the hotel was through the small restaurant entrance where we were guided to the tiny lift to the temporary reception area.   I couldn't believe the state of the corridor, lift and even more disappointed with our room especially as Booking.Com had advised me that I had been upgraded to an Executive Room.  Our room was nothing like the Executive Room advertised on the hotel website.  The room was very small and in a very poor decorative state, the bathroom sink had a huge crack in it and there was no bath as I had requested but only a shower.  I went back down to reception to see if there was a room with a bath and I told the receptionist on duty I had been allocated an Executive Room.  I was told that the room was an Executive Room (absolutely no way) and that unfortunately the only rooms with baths were on the upper floors undergoing refurbishment.  I was too tired after a long day travelling to take the matter up any further.  Apart from the cracked sink, the shower didn't empty when using it and so you ended up standing in inches of shower water.  Our whole experience then got even worse when we went down to the Benjamin Restaurant for breakfast on the Monday morning.  On entering we told the lady at the entrance that we were staying at the Dylan Hotel and had breakfast booked.  We were shown to a table, we were the only 2 customers.  We only had pastries and hot drinks.  On leaving we were given a bill by the young gentleman serving us.  We explained that we were on a bed and breakfast rate with the hotel and were told that they had no knowledge of this as they were not part of the hotel, we needed to have given them breakfast vouchers on arrival at the restaurant which reception staff would have given to us (but hadn't) and we couldn't leave without paying.  By this time the lady at the front desk of the restaurant had also come over and said we needed to pay the bill as they are independent of the hotel.  Their tone and manner was extremely unpleasant.  We managed to agree to them letting us go up to the hotel reception to get the breakfast vouchers and take them back down.  At no point during check in had we been told that we needed breakfast vouchers nor were we given any.  The whole breakfast experience made us feel so uncomfortable that we didn't go down for breakfast the next morning and therefore ended up paying for a breakfast we didn't have.  Unfortunately, our whole stay at The Dylan Hotel from issues before arrival, check-in, room provided and breakfast was very disappointing and stressful, and spoilt a holiday we had been very much looking forward to.  I've contacted both the Dylan Hotel and Booking.Com twice since the beginning of January and have not received a response from either.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

I would encourage you to spend a couple of extra bucks on a “city view” room. The view of the Empire State Building was worth it! The room also came with a nice kitchenette if you want to eat in or simply store things in the fridge and reheat in the microwave later.

If you are lucky and they pick up the phone they tell you that there is only one person at the desk - how this at all possible?!- ⁠room cleaning - it is not done on a daily basis for some reason, you have to call reception (see point one) or catch the housekeeping staff in the corridor and ask them to clean the room. One day when I managed to reach out the reception the response was “I will try to ask housekeeping as it is not my department”. This is not acceptable. In addition the cleaning quality is very average as they don’t clean corners at all (previous guests left a bottle in one corner and no one picked it up until now!). All in all for the 8 night stay we had 3 (!!!) cleanings and 2 of these 3 we had to ask them to come. This is the level we have never seen before.- ⁠cafe staff is not really client oriented. When we ask to make an omelette they were really puzzled and started to discuss me in Spanish (is it normal practice in your hotel?), however they stopped immediately as my wife told them she understands Spanish. Another weird situation was when I asked the cafe staff to open a bottle of wine for me the guy told me there is cork fee (!), however another guy opened it with no questions. Also they rejected to give me wine glasses into the room. One day I asked the cafe staff to send the burger into the room he told me I cannot as I’m alone here (again!) but despite that he charged 18% service!- ⁠another point is there is no drinking water in the room(!). I had to pay $10 for the bottle of water. We have been travelling a lot but this is the first time we see NO water at all in the room. Also for some reason there is no electric kettle as if you don’t drink coffee and you want tea you need to go and pay for it in the cafe. My wife caught a cold and she had to drink hot tea every day 3-4 times a day paying $5 per tea! I spoke to the hotel manager but she didn’t seem too much client oriented as well. She was very formal and was more giving an excuses (“room services sometimes late”) rather than helping. The same day after we discussed the above mentioned issues with her the room service didn’t come. And at the departure day when I asked for help with 4 pieces of luggage the front desk told me to go find a cart near the doors and handle the luggage by myself. The hotel manager proposed $500 refund but do you really think 10% off the total price I paid as a refund is enough when you charge double of the total price because of the holiday season?!- ⁠all in all the hotel rating is completely overrated. The only positive thing is location which is great indeed. The rest feedback about hotel is far below average especially given the price we have paid $4500."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

After walking past it once, and throwing up again immediately in front of the restaurant next door, I made my way in and was delighted to find that it was a real building that actually existed! Desk staff were friendly and welcoming (partially out of pity I'm sure) and found my booking without too much trouble. One thing they couldn't find however was my room key, which was a little concerning. After a few minutes of looking for it, they resolved to just unlock the room with the master key and told me they'd bring me my key as soon as they found it (they never did, thankfully I was only there for the night so this was no problem short of sheepishly explaining the situation at check-out)As far as the room goes, you get what you expect for the price. It was small, it had a bed, a toilet, and a shower, which was everything I needed at the time. It seemed fairly well maintained and clean. I'm not sure it's a room I would choose to spend more time in than I had to, with the slightly claustrophobic feel of everything (including the tiniest TV I have ever seen) and the charming view of dingy brick wall out of the confusingly designed windows. But as a base of operations on a trip where you'll be spending most of your time out and about, it's hard to beat the convenience of the location for the low price offered. At no point in my experience did I feel unsafe or uncomfortable, honestly with the size of the building it's hard to feel a whole lot of anything. All in all, if I ever needed a place to stay for cheap again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here.

As I planned my December trip, I thought where else would I stay but at Park Terrace - no point in risking or trying other hotels - I’ve found my home away from home.  It was just like a continuation … Beverly saw me off the last time and this time, she helped me check in and choose a better room.  It was like we picked up where we left off. Arlette and Kateryna also assisted after.  Ricardo was there to lend a helping hand to tag my luggage.  My room this time did not have a view, but it didn’t matter — it was clean, it had the amenities I wanted, it was a space I could relax and recharge and I felt safe.   The Nespresso helped as well as the tea selection given by the team - thanks for introducing me to Harney & Sons.  Don’t forget the unlimited supply of fresh drinking water - bring as many bottles you can carry.  The bed and pillows will bring you to dreamland —- they’re like clouds embracing and lulling you to sleep.  Then you wake up ready for another full day of activities.  The location is just perfect — close to great restaurants and bakeries, 5th Avenue, subway, bus stops, etc. With the Bryant Park Winter Wonderland - more options were available.  As I mentioned in my previous review, this hotel is a gem — it sparkles and shines where it’s needed.  To management - change things which have to be improved but keep your team - they’re one of the reasons I came back.    I’ll mention everyone I encountered who made my vacation a truly wonderful time — Beverly(plus points for managing to upgrade my room), Arlette, Kateryna, Ricardo, Yovanni, Sean, Raquel, Jean, Abdulli, Alvin and of course my chat mate, the man — Harry!  We know we encounter those who work at the front desk and housekeeping fleetingly because we have our activities to attend to.  But this team is extra special because they’re genuine - authentic.  They carry their hearts on their sleeves.  Thanks again … till my next visit. …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

The room was clean and they even came in the next day and made the bed, provided fresh towels, etc. (something even expensive hotels have cut back on due to Covid-19).

We were allocated a room at the back of the hotel as we were staying a number of nights and it would be quieter. This did mean forsaking a view but having stayed at a 4* boutique hotel elsewhere in the city on previous visits, I can honestly say that the quality of sleep was much better - it was so quiet! The room had recently been updated/redecorated and was very spacious and clean. The bathroom, although slightly dated, was clean with a very powerful shower - lots of bath/hand towels were provided plus a reasonable hair dryer. This hotel is perfectly located - it's just off Times Square and it took us 5 minutes to walk to the theatre for our pre-booked show!

The hotel and the room were clean. The room was a good size for a NYC hotel room. The bar area and Lobby were very nice. The valet parking staff were quick and efficient. This hotel’s location is perfect for those looking to see Rockefeller Center, a show at a nearby theater or do some shopping on fifth avenue. Subway access is available at the end of the block via the 7th Ave station. Unfortunately, that is where the positive part of this review ends. The Residences is located on the 44th floor of the Hilton Midtown. There are only three elevators which can access the 44th floor. During the first half of our stay only 2 of 3 elevators were working resulting in 20+ minute waits on the elevator. Elevator access was chaotic at times with people packed into this narrow hallway and spilling out into the Lobby at times. The Residences Check-in is separate from the Main hotel check in. When we checked in on the 44th floor we were told that they would provide us with a discount code for the Valet. The front desk was unstaffed when we checked out of the hotel and there was a sign stating to see the Main hotel desk. I went to the Main hotel lobby and the gentleman at the front desk took my room keys and said he would go ask his supervisor about the valet because they don’t “deal with those people upstairs”. I not only didn’t get my discount but paid MORE than the $70/day shown advertised on the website and my reservation. Another incident we had when we were leaving involved the Main hotel bellmen. Since the Residences desk was unstaffed at the time we left, I had to go downstairs in search of a cart to get all of our bags and packages to the valet area. I couldn’t find anyone in the front lobby but saw a cart just outside the back door in the valet area. Upon coming downstairs with all our belongings on the cart, a staff member came up to us yelling at us about the cart and snatched it out of my sons hands. Only to abandon it outside the hotel in valet area. Fortunately, my son followed our property while I went to the front desk to check out. By the time I came outside no bellman was present to help load the car. So what was the point?Another issue we experienced was with the Thanksgiving parade itself. We came downstairs about an hour before the parade. There had been a flyer left in our room the night before with information about the parade. When we went downstairs to get our place in front of the hotel for the parade, we were refused entry and told we needed a wristband. Neither the flyer nor front desk at the Residences mentioned a wristband. So we went back into the hotel front desk to ask and were told they sold out of wristbands yesterday. We would have been happy to have purchased a wristband had anyone mentioned the need for one to stand in front of the hotel I was paying $900+/night to stay in. As a result, we had to go across the street in the back of the mob and couldn’t see anything but the balloons. Ruined our Thanksgiving parade experience. Other items I didn’t care for at this property include: The mattress was horribly worn and uncomfortable and the furniture was incredibly uncomfortable. There is no free breakfast or coffee in the residences. There is a coffee maker in the room, but housekeeping didn’t replenish it the last 3 days we stayed. I called once and it took an hour for them to bring us 4 coffee pods. There is no true room service. The “room service” in this hotel is from the convenience store like herb n kitchen restaurant and is delivered in a sack. I wouldn’t recommend Herb N Kitchen due to the prices and lack of freshness of things we purchased. There is a nice grocery a block and a half up 6th Ave and you can get delivery from most places in the city. No way to play subscription services on the TVs so you're stuck with their pay per view or whats on cable. Hourly phone calls the 2nd day of our stay from sales staff. It took 3 days to get a receipt from this hotel. The first one they sent showed $0. So Hilton corporate wouldn't give me credit for the stay. I was actually told at one point I didn't get any points because I wasn't a paying registered guest! I guess $6640.00 isn't enough to be considered a paying guest.  All was eventually fixed but it took several days. Incompetence and mismanagement is the theme of this hotel and Hilton will be my last choice of hotels from now on."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

I stayed at the hotel in January for 2 nights with my friend, in February for 3 nights and I will never go back to the hotel again.  The first stay we encountered low water pressure, so it was a problem taking showers.  I booked again in February and there were issues with the heater which kept the room hot.  The thermostat didn't work properly.  The second night an engineer came to \"fix\" the heater.  The same problem occurred as it was blasting hot air which made it hard to breathe.  I was being treated for a sinus infection and told the front desk.  I went to bed at midnight and got up at 4 a.m. as it was unbearable.  The third night, I had to worry about not having water.  The water was turned off from 9 p.m. until after 9 a.m.  or later the next morning. (BTW - the water seems to be turned off a lot as I heard from family who stayed at the hotel.)  I spoke to Steve Parks who said he was going to compensate me for $443 for the inconvenience.  This did not happen, so after multiple attempts to reach Steve Parks, I called the hotel, finally got ahold of him and he placed me on hold to never speak to me again. I was left on hold for more than an hour.  I called on another line and was told he left the building.  This is the kind of service the Bentley gives its guests.  Steve Parks does not want to hear from you and your complaints.  The hotel is old, not that clean, the carpets are dirty, and the bathroom had rust stains in the shower.  When you book at a hotel, a person should not have to worry about having a room that the furnace is broken or there is no water to go to the bathroom or brush your teeth.  The Bentley was an old office building and is not conducive to operating as a hotel.  My family has stayed at the hotel and had similar problems.

They may not seem that far, but when you're hauling luggage, it feels like a mile!)The cons: room was underwhelming (very basic and no frills), NO vent in the bathroom (yes, I looked), smallest hotel elevator I've ever experienced (not much bigger than a phone booth), and only one elevator was working (there were long waits for the elevator as a result).  Smell of ammonia in our room was overpowering when we arrived.Granted, my wife and I did have a good stay, but the room was underwhelming to the point that I spent more time hanging out in the lounge/lobby than in our room (other than to sleep).

Hotel staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Guest suite was clean, comfortable but furnishings are a bit worn and dated. Guest bathroom is a bit cramped with minimal counter space but is expected with urban hotels. Shower water pressure was a bit low at the time of my stay. Overall, good, decent stay.

It was quite the pleasure getting to take a trip home and stay here, in one of our favorite neighborhoods.Prior to our stay I chatted with the team to see about any additions I could reserve or order for my husband's birthday, without asking was told there would be a gift upon our arrival for him in our room. As we normally travel for celebrations (birthdays, anniversaries, etc) this was completely unexpected and quite the treat. Upon arrival we were greeted at the desk and welcomed with glasses of Prosecco, which after a long trip was greatly appreciated. Our visit morning trip out for breakfast we flipped the signage on the door to share we were \"out on the town\", thoroughly shocked upon our return the room was already made up. In all my traveling I have never left for so little time and returned to our room being cleaned and refreshed so quickly, never really seeing any of housekeeping out and about on the floors -- quite magical.I believe one of the best and probably most overlooked aspect of staying at The Roxy is the white noise built in to the rooms. It did an amazing job blocking out excess noise. We were still able to hear the live music but it wasn't anything dramatic, just enough to be comfortable. A great benefit is if you don't want to leave the hotel you really don't have to -- you have a restaurant, oyster bar for happy hour, pool table and live music nightly, a jazz club, and a movie theatre!

Room is quiet. AC works well even on higher floors!  Heat rises, but the AC meets the challenge. Eco friendly as well. Windows and natural light are excellent with blackout curtain if needed, but who wants to sleep in NYC during the day??  Window opens, but only with a small space for safety purposes.

The staff & housekeeping will come 24/7 to take care of any issue you may have. They are timely in their response and always come with a smile. I cannot name one negative issue with this hotel. Restaurant has delicious food and room service is fabulous. Everyone is hardworking and each person I encountered had such a giving spirit.

Because of ongoing construction, there is no lobby or restaurant, and I reiterate, you didn't want to be outside.

There is a large new television in the recently remodeled immaculate room, which clearly states NETFLIX and other streaming channels.  Two engineers PLUS their manager came up to address the issue telling me they'd be in touch in 10 minutes, including several calls down to the office.

One of our friends has a health condition that required extra support, but Julian it made it easy and  it felt it was home away from home, helping us with her and making sure her equipment was delivered to our room with no issues.   Thank you to all.  It was really appreciated.    Highly Recommend!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]}

The  hotel was in a good location in Times square and was walking distance to most attractions. Also there was a bus stop near by that was easy to access. Unfortunately the room was small for a family of four, The room was dirty and full of dust and there were belonging of other customers left in the room On  our first day we arrived late around 9 o'clock. the toilet was leaking so we reported it and n one attended to look at it  as we were tired i just slept on it that night. In the morning I decided to to take a shower, the  shower head had mould covered all over , its appearance would make you sick and puts you off the showering. We tired to flush the toilet it was blocked. At this point i had enough so i decided to  go down to reception. After waiting 45 min.  I was grated by one of the receptionist and he was really helpful and it took him 20 min to decided what to do so she suggested to change rooms as i had photos of the room, the shower head and toilet  leaking. We moved to another room which was smaller but still the room was all dusty with spider web in corners. I told the housekeeping when they arrived the room they said they will look into it.  they actually don't have any cleaning standards. The beds are horrible and mattress are not comfortable at all.  So if you  are keen on a clean hotel like me, i would not recommend . Unfortunately worse hotel stay I had for a long time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3"}]}

At over $500 Australian Dollars per night in NYC, I expected much much better.  The Hotel’s policy is as follows:  Do everything to suit the Hotel.  Do nothing that is helpful to the paying customer.  Examples are:  NO HOUSE KEEPING, in other words no clean sheets, no cleaning of the bathroom, no sweeping of the floors.  We were here for 7 nights in early Sep 2023.  Totally unacceptable.  NO HOTEL LAUNDRETTE available for  patrons staying there. Told to go to Chelsea laundrette a 5 minute walk away.  When we got there the place was closed.  If it was open we would have had to wait in there at least an hour for washing & drying.  This shows how uncaring the Hotel is towards its Patrons.  We’re here for sight seeing, not for traipsing around NYC to do our laundry.  POOR SELECTION OF TV CHANNELS PROVIDED.  Very small writing desk provided.  The lighting in the room is very weak.  The lighting in the bathroom is very poor - it was impossible to see where I had shaved my face. I’m not exaggerating, for what we paid we got no services whatsoever.  In comparison we stayed at Hilton Garden Inn Washington DC Downtown, and all the services were provided, including an indoor swimming pool, & it was much cheaper.  New Yorkers like to think they live in the best city in the world but they don’t.  Washington is clean & has beautiful greenery & parks everywhere.  Washington leaves NYC for dead.

The location is as good as is gets if you are planning to attend a performance at Lincoln center. The hotel is just a minute walk, literally across the road. Some  good restaurants like Bar Boloud and Boloud Sud are also a minute away, Columbus circle 5min walk, Central Park a block away, Broadway a step out. +Staff. Everyone from managers at the reception to housekeeping services were professional and helpful. No BS, no delays, everything run smoothly from check-in to check-out. +Dogs. Empire Hotel has a dog friendly policy, and not towards small dogs only. Big four-legged companions are welcomed as well. Rooms. Yes, rooms could benefit greatly from thoughtful renovation. But even with the tired decor, the bed linen was fresh and crisp, towels in the bathroom white and fluffy. As a frequent guest of the hotels worldwide I appreciate crisp linen and towels more than fresh wallpaper. Air con. Yes it is loud. However if you are not a finicky sleeper you would have no problem at all. Pity you can’t open the window, fresh air always helps. Alas, I just turned the air con off (I still got the noise, but the temperature was ok).  Overall Empire Hotel was an excellent choice for the purpose. At the price of $200/night I couldn’t ask for more at such location. If you want a spacious newer room with modern appliances be prepared to pay at least twice of the that price elsewhere.

The state of the bathtub in our room was appalling - it was cracked and peeling, posing a significant safety hazard. The sharp, flaking pieces of the tub could have easily caused physical injury, a risk unacceptable in any accommodation, let alone one costing $2,600 for two nights. However, the response to our complaint was far from satisfactory. Despite the high price, the hotel was fully booked and Joseph offered no apology or suitable alternative, merely stating the tub was usable. He said \" the tub was functional, but cosmetically unappealing\"Joseph's impatience and dismissiveness during our discussion over the phone were profoundly disrespectful. He even questioned our calculation and communication abilities and insisted we visit the front desk for an explanation.  Joseph's handling of the situation was not only inadequate but also suggestive of racial discrimination. Despite my status as a Platinum Elite member, Joseph's attitude and decisions implied a discriminatory stance, especially given his refusal to acknowledge our concerns adequately and his insinuation that we were being unreasonable.When we highlighted the tub's condition, Joseph's offers of $250 in food and beverage credits or 3,500 reward points felt both insufficient and irrelevant. He denied us access to another Suite, despite availability shown on the Marriott app, claiming it was reserved for VIP guests. This discriminatory treatment was deeply unsettling.  After complaining to Marriott headquarters, he seemed forced to come to apologize. However there is no sincerity in his apology, when asking if he understands why we felt being mistreated, he refuted every points we mentioned before and insist that every decisions he made were entirely right. This behavior was especially upsetting to my girlfriend, who was reduced to tears by his insensitivity.  Most concerning was Joseph's implication that our presence posed a physical threat to him. This baseless accusation is not only deeply offensive but also a severe allegation that escalates the situation far beyond a customer service failure. His refusal to inspect the room, citing fear of our presence, was both unjustified and indicative of a prejudiced mindset.  This entire experience has left us feeling not only disregarded as customers but also discriminated against. It is unacceptable for guests, particularly those paying a high price for what should be a luxury experience, to be subjected to potential safety hazards and such levels of disrespect.  Moreover, it became evident that the hotel had knowingly assigned us a room with a damaged bathtub. This revelation, coupled with Joseph's dismissive and confrontational approach, severely impacted our experience. Not only was the bathtub in the room damaged, but the mirror and one standing lamp were also broken, and there were cracks in the sink. The bathrobe even had hair from the previous guest on it. It's hard to imagine this is a hotel worth $1,300 a night.   This encounter not only reflects poorly on the Marriott brand but also raises serious concerns about racial bias and customer disregard, particularly given the high price we paid for what was expected to be a luxury experience. We expect Marriott's corporate team to address these issues urgently to ensure that such discriminatory and disrespectful treatment is not repeated with other guests.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

DO NOT go alone if you are a female traveling.I had lower expectations of this hotel before coming here because I understood it was a hotel in the middle of the city, but I NEVER EVER could have expected anything like this stay.(Disclaimer: Every claim made in this review is in no-way a “false statement”.The First Amendment provides that Congress make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise. It protects freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and the right to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.)ROOMS:It seems like there were many different rooms styles, but we were given a single bunk bed for 4 men and 1 woman. 2 men had to spend and extra $50 to sleep in a parking garage down the block.Though the room was clean overall, we were only given the top sheet and a knitted blanket for comfort on the beds, and the knitted blankets we were given had blonde hairs all over them (everyone that stayed in the room that night is brunette).The AC worked really well as the room would heat up quickly.SERVICE:The service/overall experience was also less than my standards.1. Over $500 was spent when not even everyone was able to fit into the room.2. I was followed into the WOMAN’s bathroom by a MAN who began shaking my stall door asking for me to “show him what’s behind the door”. He would not leave. I was made uncomfortable to the point of calling the police. I then locked myself in the hotel room the rest of the night.3. The hotel claimed I MADE UP the bathroom incident out of rage.4. The hotel claims that it is non-smoking, however none of the smoke detectors in the hallway were working, and multiple people were smoking right in the middle of the hallway.LOCATION:This is the middle of NYC so traffic and people being heard at all hours of the night is to be expected.Overall, our experience at this hotel was awful. We could barely stay one night."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

I was in NYC for the holidays and obviously understand things are a bit more expensive but for over $800 a night this was nowhere near close to worth that amount when I would’ve gotten better service/basic amenities at a Marriott Courtyard or whatever equivalent.To start with, whenI was outside looking at where the entrance was to check in, the bellman looked like work was the last place on earth he wanted to be and  just looked at me and pointed to the front door when I had a 50 lb suitcase and two other bags that I had to take down the stairs and through two doors myself. For what they and calling yourself a luxury hotel, that is unacceptable already soured my stay before I even walked in. The “lobby” if that’s what you want to call it is basically a coffee shop with someone assisting with check-in. Not my thing personally but if that’s what you’re looking for by all means go for it. When I was inside, the staff was friendly and helpful with my check in.Our guest room was clean but again for the price and it being a “four star” hotel, I was pretty disappointed. Two of the outlets in the room next to one of the beds didn’t work, the TV remote was not synced up to the tv so it was very difficult to change channels and the cable wasn’t working so the screen was constantly flickering. The bathroom having just 2 towels and a small wash cloth for 2 people staying there wasn’t enough. Again at other places I’ve stayed with similar ratings, there are extra towels, a towel for the wet bathroom floor by the shower (I came close to falling when I got out of the shower), bath robes. I understand it is an older building which is part of the charm but it felt extremely minimalist and not up to the level of a luxury hotel.The hotel is in a great location but for what they charge it isn’t close to worth it and there are so many better options."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Barcade Chelsea just a block away, and a bunch of good restaurants nearby.Getting there from JFK was easy using AirTrain and Subway (E & F), and it was just as easy to get back.Having wired ethernet by the desk was great, especially as I had to do an online presentation, and it's always better to avoid the latency and jitter of WiFi. Though most of the time I did just use the WiFi, which was great apart from blocking SSH connection to ports other than 22 (why?).The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had everything I needed (including a decent amount of space for my stuff). I've never used a bed top ironing board before, but it worked well enough and the iron itself was nice and clean. Having a safe in the room was reassuring when leaving things behind."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

There is also no lobby for a short staying.The most ridiculous thing is laundry credit. It probably doesn’t matter to many short stay travelers, but we stayed for 4 days so we actually asked about it. They charge laundry BY PIECE. A pair of socks costs 6 dollars, and a pair of paints charges 19 dollars. So with the TWENTY DOLLAR per stay credit, we party of three can wash one pair of paints with the credit. Given the room rate we gave, we really don’t deserve this bare minimum treatment. If you want to rob your customers, just rob. The management and hospitality team is accommodating and they listen to requests. I bet they get complaints a lot. I genuinely wish the hotel improves their offering.

The radiator made the room very hot initially, but it was easy to switch it off and the window could be opened. The wifi worked fine. Each floor had six rooms, some for one , others for two people, and there was a shower and bathroom per floor. It also was good to have a kitchen downstairs with a couple of fridges, two electric rings and a microwave plus some pots and pans, plates etc. Making my own breakfast and occasional other meals helped me save money. The location couldn't have been better - a short walk from both the A and E subways, and many sights walkable (depending on how much you enjoy walking!) Plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops close by. I didn't have much interaction with the staff - the guy checking me in was pleasant enough as were the cleaners.

There was definitely a temperature difference so be aware of that. Another minor concern was the Murphy bed...it's not comfortable.  I didn't know what to expect but, since I wanted to be closer to the a/c, we switched beds with our son.  Big mistake...he could sleep on the ground and be comfortable but not me. Last issue is the sitting space...if you have 4 people, there's only really space for 3 people to sit and watch tv.  A couch and a chair.   Overall, though, we couldn't have been happier with the room.  Nice sized refrigerator, small but enough space to move around and not feel overly crowded. The location is great...on Wall Street so the Wall St Station is only a few blocks away.  Pier 11 is right down the street which gives you access to the ferry.  A lot of dining options in the area. Then there are the workers.  I never entered or left the building where they didn't have a smile on their face and say \"hello\" or \"goodbye/have a great day\".  They were attentive, helpful and, most of all, friendly.  Yes, the cost is a little high buuuuuut you're in NYC....everything is expensive!!  I would rather pay a little more for more space than be in a cramped room for the same price.  …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

When we checked in the desk clerk thanked us for being a repeat visitor and upgraded our room and gave us two free drink coupons. I couldn't believe it! It was so nice of him. Our room was enormous with three closets (!), a balcony, a kitchenette, a large tv, blackout blinds, and one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept on. I slept so soundly. Housekeeping was generous with the toiletries. The only tiny negative was the size of the bathroom. Two people cannot be in there at the same time. It would have been smart when they were renovating the rooms to expand the bathroom into one of the closets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4"}]}

On the Expedia site, it said there was a free charging station on premises for my rental car, which is the only reason I booked this hotel, as there were many hotels in the same price range. I arrived at the hotel and was waiting to pull up in front of the hotel for about 5 minutes while another driver took up 2 parking spots to let another guest out. I got into the hotel and the front desk rep said there is no free charging station on site, and said Expedia put that on their site in error. I called Expedia once i got into the room, and they said there was nothing they could do even though they put it on the site in error. I could cancel and lose my money or stay. The room was nothing compared to the pictures, as it extremely small and wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, as it's so outdated and is in need of a large renovation. The wallpaper was coming off the wall, there was rust in the bathtub, and just barely met basic needs. The elevators are very old, and paint chipping from the stairwells. The parking is also costly even for a night, and a block away.…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

We have stayed in various Hotels throughout NYC during the Christmas season for the last 18 years. We arrived around 3pm and waited at the check in desk for over 30 mins and were told room would not be ready for at least another hour. We dropped our bags then attempted to find a restroom in the lobby First 2 we went to were not open and the 3rd ones we found on the 4th floor were filthy. Finally around 6:30 I received a call from Anna Marie stating the room was finally ready and she would credit me 300 dollars for the inconvenience, This was never done. Tuesday morning called to get a reservation for Breakfast was supposed to be included in our stay because we booked with Amex and was told not taking any more reservations or walk ins for the day because they were so busy. Tuesday night starting around 11:30 we called the front desk because their were people parting in the hallway. After 3 calls nothing was ever done this went on till after 2am. Wednesday 4:30 am wake up to Head to JFK requested my car from Valet. Came down and no car asked the door man and he laughed stating they do not get in till 6am and I need to read the signs. We could not wait until 6am since we would have missed our fight to London. Now we were forced to Uber to JFK and leave our car for 10 day's @ $115 per day. The Uber to JFK was $160 there and $270 and 2-1/2 hours back into the city to Pick up my car after and 8 hour flight back from Paris. When I talked to manager on duty he offered me no help. Do yourself a favor avoid this place there are much better hotels in NYC were you can get a good nights sleep, your car, the credit you were told you were going to get and Breakfast."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}
